\section{Particle and astroparticle physics in the context of generalized models of gravity}
\label{sec.title}
\subsection{Introduction and motivation}
\label{sec.intro}
During the last few decades, the physics community has been witness of
very important experimental results in both particle physics and
cosmology. On the one hand, the missing ingredient of the standard
model of particles---the Higgs boson---, was observed independently by
two of the experiments of the Large Hadron Collider (ATLAS and CMS)
\cite{aaltonen12_eviden_partic_produc_assoc_with,aad12_obser_new_partic_searc_stand,chatrchyan12_obser_new_boson_at_mass},
and on the other hand, the acceleration of expansion of the Universe
\cite{riess98_obser_eviden_from_super_accel,perlmutter99_measur_oemeg_lambd_from_high_redsh_super},
and gravitational waves
\cite{abbott16_obser_gravit_waves_from_binar,abbott16_gw151} were
measure for the first time, and well as the correlation of Gamma-Ray
burst with the merging of neutron stars
\cite{abbott17_gravit_waves_gamma}. These observations represent the
triumph of technological development, and a milestone for theoretical
modeling.

The relevant fact is that we are able to measure the effects, but we
have no certainty of what is causing those effects. Of course,
hypothesise the existence of new forms of matter and energy is
suitable, as long as we are capable of (eventually) measure them. So
far, we do not have an explanation for what dark matter and dark
energy are made of.

From the theoretical point of view, the scarce interpretation of the
nature of the dark sector rises a plethora of questions: Are there
misunderstanding in our models? Are they incomplete or their precepts
incompatible? Why is there a huge difference between the expected
value of the cosmological constant from a fundamental quantum field
theory and the measured value in cosmology? All of these questions join the
long-standing puzzles: Is there a consistent quantum theory of
gravity? Is the gauge principle fundamental? If so, Can gravity be
understood as a gauge theory?, \emph{et cetera}.

In the quest of giving answers to those fundamental questions, we have
been driven to explore generalizations of both, the standard model of
particle physics: including new symmetries, exotic matter, etc.; and
General Relativity: adding torsion, extra dimensions, higher curvature
and torsion terms, etc. 

During the development of this project, the idea
is to analyze the phenomenology in the case of leaving the particle
model unaltered, while modifying the gravity sector.

Although the generalizations of the gravitational sector are abundant,
we shall focus in analyze two types, known as Lovelock--Cartan and
Polynomial Affine Gravity.

The first kind of model (Lovelock--Cartan) are built up from the same
precepts than General Relativity in arbitrary dimension, and allowing
the torsion of the connection to be nonvanishing
\cite{mardones91_lovel}. These models mix the \emph{minimal} generalization
of General Relativity introduced by Cartan
\cite{cartan22_sur_une_de_la_notion,cartan23_sur_les_connex_affin_et,cartan24_sur_les_connex_affin_et,cartan25_sur_les_connex_affin_et},
whose proposal was to consider a (metric compatible) connection with
torsion, and the inclusion of higher curvature terms---in scenarios
with extra dimensions---
