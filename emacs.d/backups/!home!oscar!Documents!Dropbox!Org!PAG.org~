*** Preserving volume form connection
   [2016-05-30 Mon 11:52]

In the space of solution, we want to expand our connection around a
metric compatible torsion-free connection, i.e. close to the
Levi-Civita one, therefore, we assume that it preserves a volume
element. This assumption will simplify the field equation even
further, by annihilating the second term.

*** Field equations for the torsion
   [2016-05-30 Mon 11:56]

Indeed, the nontrivial field equations are for the components
corresponding to the torsion itself (comment: Can this feature be
interpreted as consistency conditions for the assumptions? i.e., you
cannot send torsion to zero unless these conditions are satisfied)

*** Counting of degrees of freedom
   [2016-05-30 Mon 11:59] 

(Comment: I talk with my advisor, and his
opinion is that we MUST include the analysis of degrees of freedom,
highlight the spin of the "particles", and discuss about the possible
"breaking of diffeomorphisms") 

We could (in fact) add the analysis of the counting of DOF. Actually,
I wanted to add the calculations, but I still don't manage the method
as you do, so your notes are kind of useless for me! XD sorry!

*** Power-counting renormalizability
   [2016-05-30 Mon 12:03]

Despite we mention this characteristic of the model, we stress that it
is not important when one wants to analyze the quantization of the
model. And in fact, we never point polynomiality as a hint for
renormalizability, but as a simplification for the analysis.

*** The absence of qubic terms
   [2016-05-30 Mon 12:07]

We know that this is the cases.

** Introduction 
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: intro
:END:

Nowadays, the best model for gravitational interactions is General
Relativity cite:einstein1915allgemeinen , and it has proven to be
consistent---by itself---with most of the observations (see
Ref. cite:Will:2014kxa for a review). On the one hand, within the
framework of General Relativity, the standard model of cosmology has
been developed. On the other hand, the standard model of particle
physics explains very accurately the phenomena of the remaining three
fundamental interactions. However, when we wanted to conciliate both
/standard models/, we discovered that nearly the 95% of the
Universe does not fit into the picture. Therefore, a (huge) piece of
the puzzle is missing---the dark sector of the Universe, composed of
dark matter and dark energy.

In order to solve this problem one needs to add /new physics/. An
interesting question is: Where should this new physics be added?
The answer comes in two main streams, either one changes the particle
content of the Universe, i.e. modify the model of particle physics, or
one changes the model of gravitational interactions.

In this paper, we focus in the second stream by considering a recently
proposed polynomial affine gravity cite:Skirzewski:2014eta, whose
restriction to torsion-free connections yields a simple set of field
equations, which generalize those obtained in the standard General
Relativity cite:Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa.

** The polynomial affine gravity model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: PAG
:END:

The standard theory of gravity, General Relativity, was first built up
as a field theory for the metric of the spacetime
cite:einstein1915allgemeinen,einstein1915feldgleichungen,hilbert1915grundlagen,
$g_{\mu\nu}$. However, it understood soon after that the connection,
$\Gamma^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}$, does not need to be related with the
metric field
cite:Cartan1922,Cartan1923,Cartan1924,Cartan1925,Cartan-Einstein.  An
early proposal for a gravitational model built up solely with a
connection was proposed in Ref. cite:Eddington1923math. More recent
attempts were proposed in the 90's, within the framework of
metric-affine theories cite:Hehl:1994ue, and modern attempts have been
proposed in Refs. cite:Krasnov:2011pp,Poplawski:2012bw,Skirzewski:2014eta.
In this section we will highlight the model proposed in Refs. cite:Skirzewski:2014eta,Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa.

In the polynomial affine gravity the action is built up from an affine
connection, $\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}$, which accepts a
decomposition on irreducible components as
\begin{equation}
\label{gamm-decom}
  \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} 
  = \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{(\rho\sigma)} + \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{[\rho\sigma]} 
  = {\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} + \epsilon_{\rho\sigma\lambda\kappa}T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}+A_{[\rho}\delta^\mu_{\nu]},
\end{equation} 
where ${\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} =
\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{(\rho\sigma)}$ is symmetric in the lower indices,
$A_\mu$ is a vector field corresponding to the trace of torsion, and
$T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}$ is a Curtright field cite:Curtright:1980yk,
which satisfy the properties $T^{\kappa,\mu\nu } = -T^{\kappa,\nu\mu}$
and $\epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\mu\nu}T^{\kappa,\mu\nu}=0$.  The metric
field, which might or might not exists, is not needed for contracting
nor lowering or raising indices.  The relation between the epsilons
with lower and upper indices is given by
\begin{equation}
\epsilon^{\delta\eta\lambda\kappa}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}=4!\delta^{\delta}{}_{[\mu}\delta^\eta{}_{\nu}\delta^{\lambda}{}_{\rho} \delta^\kappa{}_{\sigma]}.
\end{equation}

The most general
 action preserving diffeomorphisms invariance, written
in terms of the fields in Eq. eqref:gamm-decom, is

where terms related through partial integration, and topological
invariant have been dropped.[fn:1] One can prove via a dimensional
analysis, the /uniqueness/ of the above action (see
Ref. cite:Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa).

The action in Eq. eqref:4dfull shows up very interesting features: (i)
it is power-counting renormalizable[fn:2], (ii) all coupling constants
are dimensionless which hints the conformal invariance of the model
cite:Buchholz:1976hz, (iii) yields no three-point graviton vertices,
which might allow to overcome the /no-go/ theorems found in
Refs. cite:McGady:2013sga,Camanho:2014apa, (iv) its non-relativistic
geodesic deviation agrees with that produced by a Keplerian potential
cite:Skirzewski:2014eta, and (v) the effective equations of motion in
the torsion-free limit are a generalization of the Einstein's
equations cite:Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa. In the remaining of this
section we will sketch how to find the relativistic limit of this
model, when the torsion vanishes.

First, notice that the vanishing torsion condition is equivalent to
taking both $T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ and $A_\mu$ to zero. Although this
limit is not well-defined at the action level, it is well-defined at
the level of equation of motion.[fn:3] In order to simplify the task of
finding the equation of equation of motion to take the limit, we
restrict ourselves to the terms in the action which are linear in
either $T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}$ or $A_\mu$, since these are the only terms
which will survive after taking the torsion-free limit. Therefore,
after the described considerations, the effective torsion-free action
is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eff-action}
  S_{\text{eff}} = \int\dn{4}{x} \Big( C_1\, R_{\lambda\mu}{}^{\lambda}{}_\nu \nabla_\rho %T^{\nu,\rho\sigma}
  + C_2 \, R_{\mu\rho}{}^{\lambda}{}_\lambda \nabla_\nu \Big) T^{\nu,\mu\rho}.
\end{equation}
The nontrivial equations of motion for this action are those for the
Curtright field, $T^{\nu,\mu\rho}$,
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\rho} R_{\mu]\nu} + \kappa \nabla_{\nu} R_{\mu\rho}{}^\lambda{}_\lambda = 0,
  \label{almostSimpleEOM}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ a constant related with the original couplings of the
model.

In the Riemannian formulation of differential geometry, since the curvature
tersor is anti-symmetric in the last couple of indices, the second
term in Eq. eqref:almostSimpleEOM vanishes identically. However, for
non-Riemannian connections, such term still vanishes if the connection
is compatible with a volume form. These connections are known as
equi-affine connections cite:nomizu1994affine,MO-Bryant02. In
addition, the Ricci tensor for equi-affine connections is
symmetric. For these connections, the gravitational equations are simply
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\rho} R_{\mu]\nu} = 0.
  \label{SimpleEOM}
\end{equation}

The Eq. eqref:SimpleEOM is a generalisation of the parallel
Ricci curvature condition, $\nabla_{\rho} R_{\mu\nu} = 0$, which is a
known extension of the Einstein's equations
cite:derdzinski1980classification,Besse. Moreover, these equations of
motion are also obtained from a Yang--Mills formulation of gravity
proposed in
Refs. cite:stephenson1958quadratic,kilmister1961use,Yang1974, except
that in that formulation the existence of a metric field is
assumed. The Yang--Mills-like gravity giving the above equations is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{gr-YM}
  S_{\textsc{ym}} = \int \dn{4}{x} \sqrt{g} \, g^{\mu\nu} g^{\sigma\tau} \, R_{\mu\sigma}{}^\lambda{}_\rho R_{\nu\tau}{}^\rho{}_\lambda,
\end{equation}
which can be written using the curvature two-form as
\begin{equation}
  \label{SKY}
  S_{\textsc{ym}} = \int \Tr \left( \Rif{}{} \st \Rif{}{} \right) = \int \left( \Rif{a}{b} \st \Rif{b}{a} \right).
\end{equation}
Although the actual field equations of the connection for eqref:gr-YM are the harmonic
curvature condition \cite{bourguignon1981varietes},
\begin{equation}
  \label{harm-curv}
  \nabla_\lambda R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\rho = 0,
\end{equation}
these are equivalent to eqref:SimpleEOM through the second Bianchi
identity cite:Derdzinski:1985,Besse.

The Stephenson--Kilmister--Yang (or SKY) model is not a field theory
for the connection, but for the metric. The field equation for the
metric is very constraint, and it does not accept Schwarzschild-like
solutions cite:JZcomm. However, in the polynomial affine gravity the
the metric (if exists) does not generate gravitational interaction,
and its only r^ole is to define distances. Meanwhile, the physical
field associated with the gravitational interaction is the
connection. This difference makes a huge distinction in the
phenomenological interpretation of these models.

In the following sections we shall present solutions to the field
equations eqref:SimpleEOM, in the cases where the connection is metric
or not. To this end, we first show how to propose an ansatz compatible
with the desired symmetries.

** Lie derivative and Killing vectors

:END:

The usual procedure for solving the Einstein's equation is to propose
an ansatz for the metric. That ansatz must be compatible with the
symmetries we would like to respect in the problem. A first
application of this process is seen in the Schwarzschild's metric,
which is the /most general/ symmetric rank-two tensor compatible with
the rotation group in three dimensions.

The formal study of the symmetries of the fields is accomplish via the
Lie derivative (for reviews, see
Refs. cite:yano1957theory,Choquet:1989book,Nakahara,McInerney2013). Below,
we briefly explain the use of the Lie derivative for obtaining
ansatzes for either the metric or the connection.

The Lie derivative allows to compare geometric objects settled at
different points in a manifold. Naïvely, the comparison is achieved
by /moving/ one of the objects, using the induced map of the function
which relates the points where they are defined.

#+begin_export latex
\begin{Def}[Lie derivative]
  \label{def:Lie-der}
  Given a map 
\end{Def}
#+end_export

The Lie derivative of a connection possesses an inhomogeneous part, in
comparison with the one of a rank three tensor. This can be written
schematically as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Lie-Gamma}
\mathcal{L}_{\xi} \Gamma^{a}{}_{bc} = \mathcal{L}_{\xi} T^{a}{}_{bc} + \frac{\partial^2 \xi^{a}}{\partial x^{b} \partial x^c },
\end{equation}
where $\xi$ is the vector defining the symmetry flow.

*** Killing vectors of \(SO(3)\)

The generators of an orthogonal groups are the set of anti-symmetric
tensors realised by the differential operators
\begin{equation}
  \label{Jab-rect}
  J_{ab} = x_a \partial_b - x_b \partial_{a},
\end{equation}
where $x_m = \delta_{mn} x^n$ are the covariant components of the
coordinates and $a= 1, 2, 3$, and we used the abbreviation $\partial_a =
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x^a}$. Using the (Euclidean) three-dimensional
correspondence \[ J_a = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{abc} J^{bc},\] the
algebra of the generators becomes
\begin{equation}
  \comm{J_a}{J_b} = \epsilon_{abc} J^c.
\end{equation}
These vectors can be expressed in spherical coordinates as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
J_1 &= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & -\cos\left({\phi}\right) & \cot\left({\theta}\right)\sin\left({\phi}\right)
\end{pmatrix},
\\
J_2 &= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & \sin\left({\phi}\right) & \cos\left({\phi}\right)\cot\left({\theta}\right)
\end{pmatrix},
\\
J_3 &= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
\label{Jab-sph}
\end{equation}

The geometrical objects whose Lie derivative along these vectors
vanish are said to be /isotropic/. An example of these objects is the
Schwarzschild metric. Moreover, the  Levi-Civita connection and
curvature tensors computed from this metric, hold the isotropic
property.

*** Killing vectors of \(SO(4)\), \(SO(3,1)\) and \(ISO(3)\)

In general, the orthogonal groups, \(SO(p,q)\), are generated by
\begin{equation}
  \label{SO-gen}
  J_{AB} = x_A \partial_B - x_B \partial_{A},
\end{equation}
satisfying the algebra
\begin{equation}
  \label{alg-SO}
  \comm{ J_{AB} }{ J_{CD} } = \eta_{BC} J_{AD} - \eta_{AC} J_{BD} + \eta_{AD} J_{BC} - \eta_{BD} J_{AC}.
\end{equation}
In the above relations, the capital indices run over four dimensions,
and the coordinates are Cartesian. The $\eta$ tensor gives the
different behaviours according with the signature of the orthogonal
group.

The Lorentian isotropic and homogeneous spaces in four dimensions have
isometry group either \(SO(4)\), \(SO(3,1)\) or \(ISO(3)\), and these
three groups can be obtained from the algebra eqref:alg-SO, after
a \(3+1\) decomposition, i.e. \(J_{AB} = \set{ J_{ab}, J_{a*} }\),
where the extra dimension has been denoted by an asterisk. In term of
these new generators, the algebra reads
\begin{equation}
  \label{alg-SO-decomp}
  \begin{split}
    \comm{ J_{ab} }{ J_{cd} } &= \delta_{bc} J_{ad} - \delta_{ac} J_{bd} + \delta_{ad} J_{bc} - \delta_{bd} J_{ac}, \\
    \comm{ J_{ab} }{ J_{c*} } &= \delta_{bc} J_{a*} - \delta_{ac} J_{b*}, \\
    \comm{ J_{a*} }{ J_{c*} } &= - \kappa J_{ac},
  \end{split}
\end{equation} 
with[fn:4] 
\begin{equation}
  \kappa = 
  \begin{cases}
    1  & SO(4) \\
    0  & ISO(3) \\
    -1 & SO(3,1)
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}

One can express the Killing vectors in spherical coordinates, while
using the embedding parametrization of the 3-sphere and 3-hyperbola on
\(\mathbb{R}^4\), 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  J_{23} &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & -\cos\left({\phi}\right) & \cot\left({\theta}\right)\sin\left({\phi}\right)
  \end{pmatrix} 
  \\
  J_{31} &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & \sin\left({\phi}\right) & \cos\left({\phi}\right)\cot\left({\theta}\right)
  \end{pmatrix}
  \\
  J_{12} &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \\
  J_{1*} &= \sqrt{1-{\kappa} r^{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &  \cos\left({\phi}\right)
  \sin\left({\theta}\right) & 
  \frac{\cos\left({\phi}\right) \cos\left({\theta}\right)}{r} &
  - \frac{\sin\left({\phi}\right)}{r
  \sin\left({\theta}\right)}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \\
  J_{2*} &= \sqrt{1-{\kappa} r^{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &  \sin\left({\phi}\right)
  \sin\left({\theta}\right) & \frac{
  \cos\left({\theta}\right) \sin\left({\phi}\right)}{r} &
  \frac{ \cos\left({\phi}\right)}{r
  \sin\left({\theta}\right)}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \\
  J_{3*} &= \sqrt{1-{\kappa} r^{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &  \cos\left({\theta}\right) &
  -\frac{ \sin\left({\theta}\right)}{r} &
  0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \end{aligned}
  \label{Kill-homotropic}
\end{equation}

** Geometric objects compatible with the symmetries
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: obj-symm
:END:

In this section we shall find the most general geometric objects
compatible with the isotropy, and isotropy-homogeneity conditions. As
mention in the previous section, the isotropy condition implies that
our fields have vanishing Lie derivative along the Killings in
Eq. eqref:Jab-sph. Similarly, the isotropy-homogeneity condition
implies that the geometrical objects have vanishing Lie derivative
along the Killing vectors in Eq. eqref:Kill-homotropic. In the tedious
task of calculating the Lie derivative of different objects, we have
used the mathematical software SAGE along with its differential
geometry package SageManifolds cite:sage,sagemanifolds.

*** Isotropic (covariant) two-tensor
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sph-2-tensor
:END:

Let us start by finding the most general isotropic, four-dimensional,
covariant rank two-tensor. We shall obtain a generalisation of the
famous ansatz for the Schwarzschild metric.

First, we assuming that the sixteen components of the tensor depend on
all the coordinates. Then, the Lie derivative of the metric along the
vector $J_3$ in Eq. eqref:Jab-sph yields
\begin{equation}
  \label{Kill_J3}
  \pounds_{_{J_3}} T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{ \partial T_{\mu\nu} }{ \partial \phi },
\end{equation}
which vanishes only if none of the components of the metric depend on
the $\phi$ coordinate. 

The Lie derivative along the other two generators of the angular
momentum yield the differential equations:
\begin{align} 
\pounds_{_{J_1}} T_{ \, t \, t }^{ \phantom{\, t } \phantom{\, t } }
& = -\cos\left({\phi}\right) \frac{\partial\,T_{tt}}{\partial \theta} \\

\frac{T_{t\phi} \cos\left({\phi}\right)
\cos\left({\theta}\right) + {\left(T_{t\theta}
\sin\left({\phi}\right) - \cos\left({\phi}\right)
\frac{\partial\,T_{t\phi}}{\partial \theta}\right)}
\sin\left({\theta}\right)}{\sin\left({\theta}\right)} \\

This result was found by A. Papapetrou cite:Papapetrou:1948. Notice
that there are six functions of the coordinates $t$ and $r$, while the
$\theta$ dependence is fixed by the symmetry. Two out of the six
functions vanish whenever one restrict to symmetric tensors, i.e.
$g(X,Y) = g(Y,X)$, such as the metric tensor. The form of the
symmetric, covariant, rank two tensor is
\begin{equation}
  g = \begin{pmatrix}
      A(t,r) & B(t,r) & 0 & 0 \\
      B(t,r) & C(t,r) & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & D(t,r) & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & D(t,r) \sin^2 (\theta)
      \end{pmatrix},
  \label{sph-met}
\end{equation}
which under a redefinition of the radial and temporal coordinates is
taken to the standard form,
\begin{equation}
  \label{Sch-met}
  g = \begin{pmatrix}
      F(t,r) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & G(t,r) & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & D(t,r) & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 0 & D(t,r) \sin^2 (\theta)
      \end{pmatrix}.

The strategy used in the previous section can be repeated for an
affine connection, and we shall end up with the most general isotropic
(affine) connection. For the sake of simplicity, we do not include the
differential equations obtained from the calculation of the Lie
derivative.[fn:5]

The last connection depends on twelve functions of $t$ and $r$, and
these are the functions to be fixed by solving the field equations
eqref:SimpleEOM.

Using the Eq. eqref:eq:isot-conn-torsion-free, we calculated the Ricci
tensor and noticed that it is not symmetric, because the connection is
not equi-affine. In order for the Ricci to be symmetric, the following
conditions must hold,

\frac{ \partial F_{000} }{ \partial r} - \frac{ \partial F_{001} }{ \partial t} + 2 \frac{ \partial F_{303} }{ \partial r} = 0,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}

\frac{ \partial F_{101} }{ \partial r} - \frac{ \partial F_{101} }{ \partial t} + 2 \frac{ \partial F_{313} }{ \partial r} = 0.
\end{equation}
There are several solutions to these conditions, and each of them
could (in principle) provides a solution to the field equations
eqref:SimpleEOM. It is worth mentioning that if we do not demand the
connection to be equi-affine, the field equations to solve would be
Eq. eqref:almostSimpleEOM, which have and extra term which cannot be
obtained from the Yang--Mills-like effective action eqref:gr-YM.

The above equations vanish if the tensor have the following form,
\begin{equation}
T = G_{00}\left(t\right) \mathrm{d} t\otimes \mathrm{d} t + \frac{G_{11}\left(t\right)}{ 1 - {\kappa} r^{2} } \mathrm{d}

\sin^2\left({\theta}\right) \mathrm{d} {\phi}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\phi}.

Under a redefinition of the ``time'' coordinate, the tensor is nothing
but the standard ansatz for the Friedman--Robertson--Walker
metric.

**** Isotropic metric solution

In Ref. cite:Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa, it was shown that for an
spherically symmetric ansatz for the metric, a Birkhoff-like theorem
holds, and the functions involved in the metric do not depend on
time. After a suitable coordinate transformation, the isotropic metric
ansatz is
\begin{equation}
g = -A\left(r\right) \mathrm{d} t\otimes \mathrm{d} t +
\frac{1}{B\left(r\right)} \mathrm{d} r\otimes \mathrm{d} r + r^{2}
\mathrm{d} {\theta}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\theta} + r^{2}
\sin\left({\theta}\right)^{2} \mathrm{d} {\phi}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\phi}.
\end{equation}
Although the metric ansatz is just the one used by Schwarzschild, the
difference is that it is not intended to solve Einstein's equations
but Eq. eqref:SimpleEOM.

The field equations turns to be
\begin{dmath}
{2 \, r^{2} B\left(r\right) \left(\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial
r}\right)^{3} + 2 \, r^{2} A\left(r\right)^{2} B\left(r\right)
\frac{\partial^3\,A}{\partial r^3} + r^{2} A\left(r\right)^{2}
\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r} \frac{\partial^2\,B}{\partial r^2} - 2 \,
r A\left(r\right) B\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}^{2} - 4
\, A\left(r\right)^{2} B\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r} -
4 \, {\left(r^{2} A\left(r\right) B\left(r\right)
\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r} - r A\left(r\right)^{2}
B\left(r\right)\right)} \frac{\partial^2\,A}{\partial r^2} - {\left(2 \,
r^{2} A\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}^{2} - 3 \, r^{2}
A\left(r\right)^{2} \frac{\partial^2\,A}{\partial r^2} - 2 \, r
A\left(r\right)^{2} \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}\right)}
\frac{\partial\,B}{\partial r}} = 0,  
\label{eq:isot-NL-1}
\end{dmath}
and
\begin{dmath}
{r^{2} B\left(r\right) \left(\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial
r}\right)^{2} - r^{2} A\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}
\frac{\partial\,B}{\partial r} - 2 \, r^{2} A\left(r\right)^{2}
\frac{\partial^2\,B}{\partial r^2} + 4 \, A\left(r\right)^{2}
B\left(r\right) - 4 \, A\left(r\right)^{2}}  = 0 .
\label{eq:isot-NL-2}
\end{dmath}
It is worth noticing that the system of equations turns linear for $A
= B$, and in this linear case, the solution of the system is given by
the well-known AdS-Schwarzschild solution, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
A (r) = 1 + \frac{c_1}{r} + c_2 r^2.
\end{equation}

The next step is to check whether the non-linear regime of the
equations can be solved. For that sake, a Frobenius power series is
proposed for both functions,
\begin{align}
A(r) &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_k \, r^{k+\alpha} , \\
B(r) &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty b_k \, r^{k+\beta}.
\end{align}
From eqref:eq:isot-NL-1 and eqref:eq:isot-NL-2, one gets the
conditions for the /critical exponents/
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\alpha ( \alpha - \beta) - 2 \beta (\beta - 1) &= -4, \\
\alpha \big[ \beta (\alpha + \beta) - 2 \beta - 4 \big] &= 0.
\end{split}
\label{eq:metric-exp}
\end{equation}

The Eqs. eqref:eq:metric-exp can be solved under certain assumptions
on the parameters.
which for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ nonzero solve the equations for the
pairs
\begin{equation}
(\alpha,\beta) = (2,2), (-1,-1), (2,-2)
\end{equation}

***** Schwarzschild-like solution

Consider the power series for the functions $A$ and $B$, with $\alpha
= \beta = -1$. The substitution of eqref:eq:metric-exp into
Eqs. eqref:eq:isot-NL-1 and eqref:eq:isot-NL-2 yields the following
relation between the firsts expansion coefficients,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a_1 &= \frac{ a_0 }{ b_0 } & b_1 &= 1 \\
a_2 &= 0 & b_2 &= 0 \\
a_3 &= \text{undetermined} & b_3 &= \text{undetermined} \\
a_4 &= \frac{ a_3 b_0 - a_0 b_3 }{ b_0^2 } & b_{4} &= \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{b_{3}}{b_{0}}-\frac{a_{3}}{a_{0}}\right) \\
a_5 &= \frac{9}{20} \frac{ (a_{0} b_{3}-a_{3} b_{0})}{ b_{0}^3} & b_5 &= \frac{5}{4} \frac{ a_{3} b_{0} - a_{0} b_{3}}{ a_{0} b_{0}^2} \\
&\vdots & &\vdots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Notice that the series are determined once the values of the
coefficients $a_0$, $b_0$, $a_3$ and $b_3$ are fixed. Additionally,
the series truncate (as expected) for $a_0 = b_0$ and $a_3 = b_3$,
case in which the physical interpretation of the parameter is well
understood, $a_0$ is related with the mass of the physical object,
while $a_3$ is related with the cosmological constant. However, for
other values of the constants it is not clear whether the asymptotic
structure of the spacetime characterised by this metric is well
behaved cite:geroch13_gener.

For the case $a_0 = b_0$, the coefficients are
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a_{1} &= 1
&
b_{1} &= 1
\\
a_{2} &= 0
&
b_{2} &= 0
\\
a_3 &= \text{undetermined} 
& 
b_3 &= \text{undetermined} 
\\
a_{4} &= \frac{a_{3}-b_{3}}{a_{0}}
&
b_{4} &= -\frac{3 (a_{3}-b_{3})}{2 a_{0}}
\\
a_{5} &= -\frac{9 (a_{3}-b_{3})}{20 a_{0}^2}
&
b_{5} &= \frac{5 (a_{3}-b_{3})}{4 a_{0}^2}
\\
&\vdots 
&
&\vdots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The substitution $a_0 = -2 M$, $a_3 = \Lambda$ and  $b_3 = \Lambda +
\epsilon$, the coefficients become,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a_{1} &= 1 &
b_{1} &= 1 \\
a_{2} &= 0 &
b_{2} &= 0 \\
a_{4} &= \frac{\epsilon }{2 M} &
b_{4} &= -\frac{3 \epsilon }{4 M} \\
a_{5} &= \frac{9 \epsilon }{80 M^2} &
b_{5} &= -\frac{5 \epsilon }{16 M^2} \\

* Background

** Perturbation theory
[[http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6448v2][Gauge-invariant variables in general-relativistic perturbations]]

* Personal appreciation of the model

1. During the XX century, models for the four fundamental interactions
   were build, and they have been very successful.
2. On the one hand, the three interactions which explain the phenomena
   in particle physics (electromagnetic, weak and strong) are build on
   the bases of gauge theories, in which the field is a connection. On
   the other hand, gravitation is modelled as a theory for the metric
   field.
3. The gravitational interaction is the only fundamental theory which
   has eluded the quantization process, despite the many attempts
   cite:tHooft:1973us,tHooft:1974bx,Deser:1974cz,Deser:1974cy.
4. It has been known from a long time that the standard theory of
   General Relativity, as proposed by Einstein
   cite:einstein1915feldgleichungen and Hilbert
   cite:hilbert1915grundlagen, was a particular case of a slightly
   general model in which the connection is not necessarily the
   Levi-Civita one, but a general affine connection cite:Cartan1922,Cartan1923,Cartan1924,Cartan1925.
5. The aforementioned generalisation of General Relativity possesses
   two independent fields, the metric and the connection, and they
   need to be varied independently cite:palatini1919deduzione. Such
   approach is commonly known as Palatini formalism, or first order formalism.[fn:7]
6. Palatini's approach to gravity is equivalent to the one by Einstein
   and Hilbert, for the four-dimensional theory of gravity (without
   matter), because in this case the field equations for the
   connection ensure that torsion vanishes and also entails the
   metricity condition, i.e., $\nabla g = 0$.
7. Shortly before the formulation of General Relativity, there were
   proposals for gravitational theories mediated by a connection
   instead of the metric
   cite:Eddington1923math,schrodinger1950space. This idea is very
   appealing to theorists, because the connection is the only
   geometrical object needed for defining the curvature of a spacetime
   (see for example Refs. cite:Cartan1923,schouten2013ricci,Besse).
8. Diverse reinterpretations of General Relativity have been proposed
   in
   Refs. cite:Plebanski:1977zz,kijowski78_new_variat_princ_gener_relat,ferraris81_gener_relat_is_gauge_type_theor,ferraris82_equiv_relat_theor_gravit,Ashtekar:1986yd,Ashtekar:1987gu,Krasnov:2007uu,Krasnov:2007ky,Krasnov:2011pp,Krasnov:2011up,poplawski07_unified_purel_affin_theor_gravit_elect,poplawski07_on_the_nonsy_purel_affin_gravit,Poplawski:2012bw. In
   many of these the idea is not to depend on the metric field to
   interpreting the gravitational interaction. Moreover, a new
   quatization procedure, based in the initial ideas of Gambini and
   Trias cite:Gambini:1980yz,Gambini:1986ew, was developed for
   quantizing the gravitational interactions
   cite:Ashtekar:1986yd,Ashtekar:1987gu,Barbero:1994an,Holst:1995pc,thiemann2007loop.

10. On the other hand, a gauge-like theory for a $GL(4,\R)$ can be
    built up by separating the trace out of the connection. However,
    this is not as interesting, because the decomposition into
    traceless and trace (in the group indices) yields an $SL(4,\R)$
    connection plus an Abelian $\R^*$ connection, the latter is
    similar to the standard Maxwell electrodynamics.
11. In order to find the complete field equations, we shall use a
    similar notation as the introduced by Kijowski[fn:8] in
    Ref. cite:kijowski78_new_variat_princ_gener_relat. 
12. Since the action depends only of the fundamental fields
    (irreducible components of the affine connection), and their first
    derivative, the field equations are given by the Euler--Lagrange
    equation,
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:ELE-conn}
      \partial_\mu
      \left(\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_\mu{\ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}}\right)}\right)
      - \frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial {\ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}}}
      &=   0,
      \\
      \label{eq:ELE-B}
      \partial_\mu
      \left(\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_\mu{\bt{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}}\right)}\right)
      - \frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial {\bt{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}}}
      &=   0,
      \\
      \label{eq:ELE-A}
      \partial_\mu
      \left(\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_\mu{ A_{\nu}}\right)}\right)
      - \frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial { A_{\nu}}}
      &=   0.
    \end{equation}
    #+END_EXPORT
13. *Field equations for the symmetric connection.*
    - First we define the canonical momenta for the connection
      component,
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} = \frac{ \partial \Lag }{
          \partial \, \partial_\mu \ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} } \equiv \frac{ \partial \Lag }{
          \partial \,  \ct{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} }.
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
    - Then they are calculated using the chain rule,
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:def-PG}
        \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} = \frac{\partial \Lag}{\partial
          \ri{\alpha\beta}{\gamma}{\delta}}
        \frac{\ri{\alpha\beta}{\ga}{\delta}}{\partial
          \ct{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}} \equiv \PG*[z]{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}
        \frac{\ri{\alpha\beta}{\ga}{\delta}}{\partial
          \ct{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}}.
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
    - The last term in eq. eqref:eq:def-PG can be calculated
      explicitly from the definition of the curvature tensor,
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:der-R-wrt-pG}
        \frac{\ri{\alpha\beta}{\ga}{\delta}}{\partial
          \ct{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}} = 4 \, \delta ^\ga_\lambda
        \delta^\mu_{[\alpha} \delta^{(\nu}_{\beta]} \delta^{\rho)}_\delta,
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
      from which it follows that
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:PG-from-z}
        \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} = 2 \PG*[z]{[\mu\nu]}{\lambda}{\rho} + 2 \PG*[z]{[\mu\rho]}{\lambda}{\nu}.
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
    - The last equation implies that the canonical momenta satisfy the
      Jacobi--Bianchi identity,
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \PG{[\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho]} = 0.
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
    - On the other hand, the second term in the Euler--Lagrange
      equations for $\Gamma$ yields
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial \Lag}{\partial \ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}} =
        \frac{\partial \Lag}{\partial \ri{\alpha\beta}{\ga}{\delta}}
        \frac{\partial \ri{\alpha\beta}{\ga}{\delta}}{\partial \ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}}.
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
    - Once again the last term can be calculated from the definition
      of curvature
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial \ri{\alpha\beta}{\ga}{\delta}}{\partial
          \ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}} = 4 \Big[  \delta^\ga_\lambda
          \delta^{(\nu}_{[\alpha} \ct{\beta]}{\rho)}{\delta} + \delta^\rho_\delta
          \delta^{(\nu}_{[\beta} \ct{\alpha]}{\ga)}{\lambda} \Big],
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
      and then,
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{align}
        \frac{ \partial \Lag }{ \partial \ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} }
        & =
        2 \, \Big[ \PG*[z]{[\nu\beta]}{\lambda}{\delta}
          \ct{\beta}{\rho}{\delta} + \PG*[z]{[\rho\beta]}{\lambda}{\delta}
          \ct{\beta}{\nu}{\delta} + \PG*[z]{[\beta\nu]}{\ga}{\rho}
          \ct{\beta}{\ga}{\lambda} + \PG*[z]{[\beta\rho]}{\ga}{\nu}
          \ct{\beta}{\ga}{\lambda} \Big] \notag
        \\
        & =
        \frac{1}{2} \PG{\nu\beta}{\lambda}{\delta} \ct{\beta}{\rho}{\delta}
        + \frac{1}{2} \PG{\rho\beta}{\lambda}{\delta}
        \ct{\beta}{\nu}{\delta}
        + \PG{\beta\nu}{\ga}{\rho} \ct{\beta}{\ga}{\lambda} \notag
        \\
        & =
        - \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\delta} \ct{\mu}{\rho}{\delta}
        - \PG{\mu\rho}{\lambda}{\delta}
        \ct{\mu}{\nu}{\delta}
        + \PG{\mu\nu}{\ga}{\rho} \ct{\mu}{\ga}{\lambda}
        .
        \label{eq:der-L-wrt-G}
      \end{align}
      #+END_EXPORT
    - Therefore, the field equations for the symmetric part of the
      connection are
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:EOM-G}
        \nabla_\mu \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} = \frac{\partial^*
          \Lag}{\partial \ct{\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} }.
      \end{equation}
      #+END_EXPORT
      In this last equation, we have used the fact that the canonical
      momenta are densities, thus there are two term (which seems to
      be missing above) that cancel themselves.[fn:9] The the asterisk
      on the RHS of Eq. eqref:eq:EOM-G denotes the partial derivative
      with respect to the connection that is not contained in the
      curvature tensor.
    - Notice that there are seven term in which the symmetric part of
      the connection enters through the curvature tensor, while it
      enters through the covariant derivative of the tensors
      $\bt{}{}{}$ and $A$ in eleven terms. Noteworthily, there are
      only two terms in which the symmetric part of the connection
      enters in both ways, these are the terms in the action with
      coupling constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.
    - Additionally, the terms in the action with couplings $C_1$ and
      $C_2$ are the only which are linear in either $\bt{}{}{}$ and
      $A$ fields. Therefore, there are the terms which could possibly
      contribute to the field equations in the sector of vanishing
      torsion, i.e., $\bt{}{}{} \to 0$ and $A \to 0$.
    - *Calculation of the $\PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}$.*
      We start calculating the $\PG*[z]{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho}$ and
      then use the Eq. eqref:eq:PG-from-z, to obtain[fn:10]

    - Notice that in the last set of contributions, the one coming
      from the term accompanied by the coupling $D_7$ yields
      zero. This is because the antisymmetrization of $\nabla A$ is
      nothing but the field strength of the potential $A$ (or the
      curvature of an Abelian 1-form). The strength does not depend on
      the connection.

* Footnotes

[fn:11] Following a procedure similar to the one for the symmetric
$\ct{}{}{}$'s.

[fn:10] We introduce the notation $\de{x}^{\alpha\beta\ga\delta}
\equiv \de{x}^\alpha \we \de{x}^\beta \we \de{x}^\ga \we \de{x}^\delta$. 

[fn:9] The covariant derivative of this tensor density is given by the
expression,
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{dmath*}
\nabla_\sigma \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} = \partial_\sigma \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} + \ct{\sigma}{\mu}{\tau} \PG{\tau\nu}{\lambda}{\rho} + 
\ct{\sigma}{\nu}{\tau} \PG{\mu\tau}{\lambda}{\rho} - \ct{\sigma}{\tau}{\lambda} \PG{\mu\nu}{\tau}{\rho} +
\ct{\sigma}{\rho}{\tau} \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\tau} - \ct{\sigma}{\tau}{\tau} \PG{\mu\nu}{\lambda}{\rho},
\end{dmath*}

then, when one contract the $\sigma$ and $\mu$ indices, the second and
sixth terms in the RHS cancel each other.

[fn:8] Our notation is inspired by that of the cited work, but it
might differs in both symbols and signs. We advise to be careful if
you would like to compare the results.

[fn:7] The name first order formalism is because for the standard
theory of gravity the field equations are second order, while they
turn into first order equations when one varies the metric and the
connection independently. 

[fn:6] 

[fn:5] Notice that in four dimensions and affine connection has
sixty-four components. Therefore, there are one hundred and ninety two
differential equations to solve for the three generators of spherical
symmetry.

[fn:4] The inhomogeneous algebra of \(ISO(n)\) can be obtained from
the ones of \(SO(n+1)\) or \(SO(n,1)\) through the Inönü--Wigner
contraction cite:Gilmore. 

[fn:3] The field equations can be consistently truncated under the
requirement of vanishing torsion. It is worth noticing that this
condition does not yield the Riemannian theory, since we are not yet
asking for a metricity condition.

[fn:2] power-counting renormalizability does not guarantee
renormalizability.

[fn:1] An example of four-dimensional topological term is the Euler density.
