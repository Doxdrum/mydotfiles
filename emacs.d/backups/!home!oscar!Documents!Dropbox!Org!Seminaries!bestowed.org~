Bestowed is a simple Javascript library that can be added to an Org-Mode file in order to create presentations.
- Uses CSS for styling
- Created using emacs' org-mode and it's default HTML export
- Nothing to install, just need to add a setting to the org-mode export
- Bestowed has simple navigation:
  - Next Slide: Space bar, j, down arrow, or right arrow
  - Previous Slide: Delete, k, up arrow, or left arrow
Go to the next slide...
* Using emacs Org-Mode for Presentations
Here are some benefits of using Bestowed
- Works with your normal workflow (if you're stuck in the 70s like me)
- Can have presenations right next to the code
- You can store presos in:
  - _git_
  - _svn_
  - *whatever*
Go to the next slide...
* How It Works
You can add bestowed to any org-mode file by doing the following:
- There is nothing to install into emacs
- At the top of the org-mode file type: _C+c C+e #_ then type 'html'
- Edit the inserted headers with the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC
...
#+OPTIONS: html-preamble:t html-scripts:nil html-style:nil
...
#+HTML_DOCTYPE: <!doctype html>
#+HTML_HEAD: <meta name="bestowed-theme" value="themes/none"><script type="text/javascript" src="../build/bestowed.min.js"></script>
...
#+END_SRC
- Export org-mode as HTML with _C+c C+e h h_
- View the exported HTML file with your browser
* Showing Code
Bestowed can show basic code blocks by adding BEGIN SRC and END SRC sections.

It looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker ps
ls -alFh
rm -rf /
#+END_SRC
- In org-mode, type _<s_ and then press _tab_
- Or start a block with BEGIN SRC and end with END SRC
* Raw HTML
Since Bestowed is very basic, if you need to do some fancy HTML you can always insert a raw block of HTML.
- Type _<h_ and press _tab_
- Or start a block with BEGIN HTML and end with END HTML
- Example:
#+BEGIN_HTML
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGO4RPzAKQY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
#+END_HTML
* Images And Links
You can include images in two ways:
- By using the raw HTML block (from the last slide)
- Or using the standard Org-mode way: typing [ [ image path ] ]
- Images can (obviously) be located online or other sites
#+ATTR_HTML: class="center"
[[http://www.seedkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vegan0.jpg]]
- Links are almost the same as images: [ [ http:// ] [ display text ] ]
* Tables
You can use standard org-mode tables too.

| One | Two   | Three | Four  |
|-----+-------+-------+-------|
| Red | Green | Blue  | Alpha |
| ‰∏Ä  | ‰∫å    | ‰∏â    | Âõõ    |
|-----+-------+-------+-------|

* Quotes
To do a quotes:
- Type _<q_ and press _tab_
- Or use BEGIN QUOTE and END QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To err is human, but to really foul things up requires adherence to the Google interview process.  --Almost Everyone
#+END_QUOTE
* Themes
This is the default theme.  You can use other themes by adding the theme path to the org-mode file.

In the export section, add the theme path in the /bestowed-theme/ meta tag:

#+BEGIN_SRC
...
#+HTML_HEAD: <meta name="bestowed-theme" value="themes/default"><script type="text/javascript" src="../build/bestowed.min.js"></script>
...
#+END_SRC

You can put a full URL into /bestowed-theme/ value to load a theme.  If the value doesn't start with _http_ then bestowed will look relative to the bestowed Javascript file.
