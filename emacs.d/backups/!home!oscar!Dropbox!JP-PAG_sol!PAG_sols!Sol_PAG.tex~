Nowadays, the best model for gravitational interactions is General
Relativity \cite{einstein15_zur_allgem_relat}, and it has proven to be
consistent---by itself---with most of the observations (see
Ref. \cite{will14_confr_between_geren_relat} for a review), including the recent observation
of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations
\cite{abbott16_obser_gravit_waves_from_binar}. On the one hand, within the framework of General
Relativity, the standard model of cosmology has been developed. On the
other hand, the standard model of particle physics explains very
accurately the phenomena of the remaining three fundamental
interactions. However, when we wanted to conciliate both \emph{standard
models}, we discovered that nearly the 95\% of the Universe does not
fit into the picture. Therefore, a (huge) piece of the puzzle is
missing---the dark sector of the Universe, composed of dark matter and
dark energy.

In order to solve this problem one needs to add \emph{new physics}. An
interesting question is: Where should this new physics be added?  The
answer comes in two main streams, either one changes the content of
the model of particle physics, or one changes the model of
gravitational interactions. However, the latter is not necessarily
independent of the former, because depending of the generalisation of
the gravitational model one obtains new particles in the spectrum.

In this paper, we focus in the second stream by considering a recently
proposed polynomial affine gravity \cite{castillo-felisola15_polyn_model_purel_affin_gravit}, whose
restriction to torsion-free connections yields a simple set of field
equations, which generalize those obtained in the standard General
Relativity \cite{castillo-felisola15_einst_gravit_from_affin}.
