\titledquestion{Energy of a steady current distribution}

In this problem, we shall derive the energy of a (steady) current
distribution, in an analogue way as done for a charge density.

Consider a current density distribution, \(\vec{j}\), leading a vector
potential, \(\vec{A}\). If one multiplies the current by a factor
\(\alpha\), the potential changes by the same factor.

\begin{parts}
  \part Show that is the current density increases from \(\alpha\) to \(\alpha +
  d\alpha\) in a time \(dt\), an electric field is created everywhere,
  \begin{equation*}
    \vec{E} = - \frac{d\alpha}{dt} \vec{A}.
  \end{equation*}

  \part What is the work done on those charges (in the current), by
  the generated electric field, per unit time? i.e. \(\frac{dW}{dt}\).

  \part Find the total internal energy, expressed in terms of the
  magnetic induction and also in terms of the current density.

  \part Consider that the current densities are given by a system of
  linear conductors. How is the energy of the system expressed?
\end{parts}
