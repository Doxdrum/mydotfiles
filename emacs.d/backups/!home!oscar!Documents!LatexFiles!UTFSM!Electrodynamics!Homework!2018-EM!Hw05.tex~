Starting with the differential expression
\begin{equation*}
  
\end{equation*}
for the magnetic induction at the point P with coordinate x produced by an incre-
increment of current / dX at x', show explicitly that for a closed loop carrying a current
/ the magnetic induction at P is
B W1
4тг
where П is the solid angle subtended by the loop at the point P. This corresponds
to a magnetic scalar potential, Фм = -1ло1п/4тг. The sign convention for the solid
angle is that П is positive if the point P views the "inner" side of the surface span-
spanning the loop, that is, if a unit normal n to the surface is defined by the direction
of current flow via the right-hand rule, Cl is positive if n points away from the point
P, and negative otherwise. This is the same convention as in Section 1.6 for the
electric dipole layer.
