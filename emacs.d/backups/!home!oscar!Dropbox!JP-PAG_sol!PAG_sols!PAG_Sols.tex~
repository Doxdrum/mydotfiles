\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.intro}
Nowadays, the best model for gravitational interactions is General
Relativity \cite{einstein15_zur_allgem_relat}, and it has proven to be
consistent---by itself---with most of the observations (see
Ref. \cite{will14_confr_between_geren_relat} for a review), including the recent observation
of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations
\cite{abbott16_obser_gravit_waves_from_binar}. On the one hand, within the framework of General
Relativity, the standard model of cosmology has been developed. On the
other hand, the standard model of particle physics explains very
accurately the phenomena of the remaining three fundamental
interactions. However, when we wanted to conciliate both \emph{standard
models}, we discovered that nearly the 95\% of the Universe does not
fit into the picture. Therefore, a (huge) piece of the puzzle is
missing---the dark sector of the Universe, composed of dark matter and
dark energy.

In order to solve this problem one needs to add \emph{new physics}. An
interesting question is: Where should this new physics be added?  The
answer comes in two main streams, either one changes the content of
the model of particle physics, or one changes the model of
gravitational interactions. However, the latter is not necessarily
independent of the former, because depending of the generalisation of
the gravitational model one obtains new particles in the spectrum.

In this paper, we focus in the second stream by considering a recently
proposed polynomial affine gravity \cite{castillo-felisola15_polyn_model_purel_affin_gravit}, whose
restriction to torsion-free connections yields a simple set of field
equations, which generalize those obtained in the standard General
Relativity \cite{castillo-felisola18_einst_gravit_from_polyn_affin_model}.

\section{Polynomial Affine Gravity}
\label{sec.PAG}
The standard theory of gravity, General Relativity, was first built up
as a field theory for the metric of the
spacetimecite:einstein15\(_{\text{zur}}\)\(_{\text{allgem}}\)\(_{\text{relatcite}}\):einstein15\(_{\text{erklar}}\)\(_{\text{perih}}\)\(_{\text{merkur}}\)\(_{\text{aus}}\)\(_{\text{allgem}}\)\(_{\text{relatcite}}\):hilbert15\(_{\text{grund}}\)\(_{\text{physik}}\), 
\(g_{\mu\nu}\). However, it understood soon after that the connection,
\(\Gamma^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}\), does not need to be related with the
metric field
\cite{cartan22_sur_une_de_la_notion,cartan23_sur_les_connex_affin_et,cartan24_sur_les_connex_affin_et,cartan25_sur_les_connex_affin_et,debever79_elie_cartan_alber_einst_letter}.
An early proposal for a gravitational model built up solely with a
connection was proposed in Ref. \cite{eddington23}. More recent
attempts were proposed in the 90's, within the framework of
metric-affine theories \cite{hehl95_metric_affin_gauge_theor_gravit}, and modern attempts have been
proposed in Refs. \cite{krasnov11_pure_connec_action_princ_gener_relat,poplawski13_affin_theor_gravit,castillo-felisola15_polyn_model_purel_affin_gravit}.
In this section we will highlight the model proposed in
Refs. \cite{castillo-felisola15_polyn_model_purel_affin_gravit,castillo-felisola18_einst_gravit_from_polyn_affin_model}.

In the polynomial affine gravity the action is built up from an affine
connection, \(\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}\), which accepts a
decomposition on irreducible components as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.gamm_decom}
  \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} 
  = \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{(\rho\sigma)} + \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{[\rho\sigma]} 
  = {\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} + \epsilon_{\rho\sigma\lambda\kappa}T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}+A_{[\rho}\delta^\mu_{\nu]},
\end{equation} 
where \({\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} =
\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{(\rho\sigma)}\) is symmetric in the lower indices,
\(A_\mu\) is a vector field corresponding to the trace of torsion, and
\(T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}\) is a Curtright field \cite{curtright85_gener_gauge_field},
which satisfy the properties \(T^{\kappa,\mu\nu } = -T^{\kappa,\nu\mu}\)
and \(\epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\mu\nu}T^{\kappa,\mu\nu}=0\).  The metric
field, which might or might not exists, is not needed for contracting
nor lowering or raising indices.  The relation between the epsilons
with lower and upper indices is given by
\begin{equation}
\epsilon^{\delta\eta\lambda\kappa}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}=4!\delta^{\delta}{}_{[\mu}\delta^\eta{}_{\nu}\delta^{\lambda}{}_{\rho} \delta^\kappa{}_{\sigma]}.
\end{equation}

The most general
 action preserving diffeomorphisms invariance, written
in terms of the fields in Eq. \eqref{eq.gamm_decom}, is
\begin{dmath}
  \label{eq.4dfull}
  S[{\Gamma},T,A] =
  \int\dn{4}{x}\bigg[
    B_1\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\rho} T^{\nu,\alpha\beta}T^{\rho,\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}
    +B_2\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\sigma}{}_\rho T^{\beta,\mu\nu}T^{\rho,\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\sigma\beta\gamma\delta}
    +B_3\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\rho} T^{\nu,\rho\sigma}A_\sigma
    +B_4\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\sigma}{}_\rho T^{\rho,\mu\nu}A_\sigma

    +C_2\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho}{}_\rho \nabla_\sigma T^{\sigma,\mu\nu} 
    +D_1\, T^{\alpha,\mu\nu}T^{\beta,\rho\sigma}\nabla_\gamma T^{(\lambda, \kappa) \gamma}\epsilon_{\beta\mu\nu\lambda}\epsilon_{\alpha\rho\sigma\kappa}
    +D_2\,T^{\alpha,\mu\nu}T^{\lambda,\beta\gamma}\nabla_\lambda T^{\delta,\rho\sigma}\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_3\,T^{\mu,\alpha\beta}T^{\lambda,\nu\gamma}\nabla_\lambda T^{\delta,\rho\sigma}\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_4\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}T^{\kappa,\rho\sigma}\nabla_{(\lambda} A_{\kappa)} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_5\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}\nabla_{[\lambda}T^{\kappa,\rho\sigma} A_{\kappa]} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_6\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}A_\nu\nabla_{(\lambda} A_{\mu)}
    +D_7\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}A_\lambda\nabla_{[\mu} A_{\nu]} 
    +E_1\,\nabla_{(\rho} T^{\rho,\mu\nu}\nabla_{\sigma)} T^{\sigma,\lambda\kappa}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\kappa}
    +E_2\,\nabla_{(\lambda} T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu)} A_\nu
    +T^{\alpha,\beta\gamma}T^{\delta,\eta\kappa}T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}T^{\rho,\sigma\tau}
    \Big(F_1\,\epsilon_{\beta\gamma\eta\kappa}\epsilon_{\alpha\rho\mu\nu}\epsilon_{\delta\lambda\sigma\tau}
    +F_2\,\epsilon_{\beta\lambda\eta\kappa}\epsilon_{\gamma\rho\mu\nu}\epsilon_{\alpha\delta\sigma\tau}\Big) 
    +F_3\, T^{\rho,\alpha\beta}T^{\gamma,\mu\nu}T^{\lambda,\sigma\tau}A_\tau \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\lambda}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +F_4\,T^{\eta,\alpha\beta}T^{\kappa,\gamma\delta}A_\eta A_\kappa\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\bigg],
\end{dmath}
where terms related through partial integration, and topological
invariant have been dropped.\footnote{An example of four-dimensional topological term is the Euler density.} One can prove via a dimensional
analysis, the \emph{uniqueness} of the above action (see
Ref. \cite{castillo-felisola18_einst_gravit_from_polyn_affin_model}).

The action in Eq. \eqref{eq.4dfull} shows up very interesting features:
(i) it is power-counting renormalizable,\footnote{power-counting renormalizability does not guarantee
renormalizability.} (ii) all coupling
constants are dimensionless which hints the conformal invariance of
the model \cite{buchholz77_dilat_inter}, (iii) yields no three-point
graviton vertices, which might allow to overcome the \emph{no-go} theorems
found in
Refs. \cite{mcgady14_higher_spin_massl_s_dimen,camanho14_causal_const_correc_to_gravit},
(iv) its non-relativistic geodesic deviation agrees with that produced
by a Keplerian potential \cite{castillo-felisola15_polyn_model_purel_affin_gravit}, and (v) the
effective equations of motion in the torsion-free limit are a
generalization of the Einstein's equations
\cite{castillo-felisola18_einst_gravit_from_polyn_affin_model}. In the remaining of this section we
will sketch how to find the relativistic limit of this model, when the
torsion vanishes.

First, notice that the vanishing torsion condition is equivalent to
taking both \(T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}\) and \(A_\mu\) to zero. Although this
limit is not well-defined at the action level, it is well-defined at
the level of equation of motion.\footnote{The field equations can be consistently truncated under the
requirement of vanishing torsion. It is worth noticing that this
condition does not yield the Riemannian theory, since we are not yet
asking for a metricity condition.} In order to simplify the task of
finding the equation of equation of motion to take the limit, we
restrict ourselves to the terms in the action which are linear in
either \(T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}\) or \(A_\mu\), since these are the only terms
which will survive after taking the torsion-free limit. Therefore,
after the described considerations, the effective torsion-free action
is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq.eff_action}
  S_{\text{eff}} = \int\dn{4}{x} \Big( C_1\, R_{\lambda\mu}{}^{\lambda}{}_\nu \nabla_\rho %T^{\nu,\rho\sigma}
  + C_2 \, R_{\mu\rho}{}^{\lambda}{}_\lambda \nabla_\nu \Big) T^{\nu,\mu\rho}.
\end{equation}
The nontrivial equations of motion for this action are those for the
Curtright field, \(T^{\nu,\mu\rho}\),
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\rho} R_{\mu]\nu} + \kappa \nabla_{\nu} R_{\mu\rho}{}^\lambda{}_\lambda = 0,
  \label{eq.almostSimpleEOM}
\end{equation}
where \(\kappa\) a constant related with the original couplings of the
model.

In the Riemannian formulation of differential geometry, since the curvature
tersor is anti-symmetric in the last couple of indices, the second
term in Eq. \eqref{eq.almostSimpleEOM} vanishes identically. However, for
non-Riemannian connections, such term still vanishes if the connection
is compatible with a volume form. These connections are known as
equi-affine connections \cite{nomizu94_affin,bryant_symmet_rieman}. In
addition, the Ricci tensor for equi-affine connections is
symmetric. For these connections, the gravitational equations are simply
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\rho} R_{\mu]\nu} = 0.
  \label{eq.SimpleEOM}
\end{equation}

The Eq. \eqref{eq.SimpleEOM} is a generalisation of the parallel Ricci
curvature condition, \(\nabla_{\rho} R_{\mu\nu} = 0\), which is a known
extension of the Einstein's equations
\cite{derdzinski80_class_certain_compac_rieman_manif,besse07_einst}. Moreover,
these equations of motion are also obtained from a Yang--Mills
formulation of gravity proposed in
Refs. \cite{stephenson58_quadr_lagran_gener_relat,kilmister61,yang74_integ_formal_gauge_field},
except that in that formulation the existence of a metric field is
assumed. The Yang--Mills-like gravity giving the above equations is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq.gr_YM}
  S_{\textsc{ym}} = \int \dn{4}{x} \sqrt{g} \, g^{\mu\nu} g^{\sigma\tau} \, R_{\mu\sigma}{}^\lambda{}_\rho R_{\nu\tau}{}^\rho{}_\lambda,
\end{equation}
which can be written using the curvature two-form as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq.SKY}
  S_{\textsc{ym}} = \int \Tr \left( \Rif{}{} \st \Rif{}{} \right) = \int \left( \Rif{a}{b} \st \Rif{b}{a} \right).
\end{equation}
Although the actual field equations of the connection for \eqref{eq.gr_YM} are the harmonic
curvature condition \cite{bourguignon81_les_de_dimen_signat_non},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq.harm_curv}
  \nabla_\lambda R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\rho = 0,
\end{equation}
these are equivalent to \eqref{eq.SimpleEOM} through the second Bianchi
identity \cite{derdzinski85_rieman,besse07_einst}.

The Stephenson--Kilmister--Yang (or SKY) model is not a field theory
for the connection, but for the metric. The field equation for the
metric is very constraint, and it does not accept Schwarzschild-like
solutions \cite{zanelli_privat}. However, in the polynomial affine gravity the
the metric (if exists) does not generate gravitational interaction,
and its only role is to define distances. Meanwhile, the physical
field associated with the gravitational interaction is the
connection. This difference makes a huge distinction in the
phenomenological interpretation of these models.

In the following sections we shall present solutions to the field
equations \eqref{eq.SimpleEOM}, in the cases where the connection is
metric or not. To this end, in appendix \ref{sec.Lie_der} we show how to
propose an ansatz compatible with the desired symmetries.

\section{Metric Solutions to the Field Equations}
\label{sec.metr_sol}
The conditions of isotropy and homogeneity are very stringent, when
imposed on a symmetric rank-two tensor, and the possible ansatz is
just the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq.ht_metr}
  g = G_{00}\left(t\right) \mathrm{d} t\otimes \mathrm{d} t +
  G_{11}\left(t\right) \left(
  \frac{1}{1 - {\kappa} r^{2}}  \mathrm{d}
  r\otimes \mathrm{d} r + r^{2} \mathrm{d}
  {\theta}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\theta} + r^{2} 
  \sin\left({\theta}\right)^{2} \mathrm{d} {\phi}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\phi} \right).
\end{equation}

In the following, we shall use the standard parametrisation of a
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq.FRW_metr}
  g = - \mathrm{d} t\otimes \mathrm{d} t +
  a^2\left(t\right) \left(
  \frac{1}{1 - {\kappa} r^{2}}  \mathrm{d}
  r\otimes \mathrm{d} r + r^{2} \mathrm{d}
  {\theta}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\theta} + r^{2} 
  \sin\left({\theta}\right)^{2} \mathrm{d} {\phi}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\phi} \right).
\end{equation}


\subsection{Cosmological metric solution with parallel Ricci}
\label{sec.ht_metr_sol}
Before considering the actual field equations, Eq. \eqref{eq.SimpleEOM},
we shall analyse the possible solutions to the parallel Ricci
equations,
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_\lambda R_{\mu\nu} = 0.
  \label{eq.parall_Ricci}
\end{equation}
The independent components of Eq. \eqref{eq.parall_Ricci} for
the ansätze in Eq. \eqref{eq.FRW_metr} are,
\begin{align}
  \nabla_t R_{tt} & \propto \dot{a} \ddot{a} - a \dddot{a} = 0, 
  %% \label{eq.mpr_cosm_ttt}
  \\
  \nabla_r R_{rt} & \propto \left( \dot{a}^2 - {a} \ddot{a} + \kappa \right) \dot{a} = 0.
  \label{eq.mpr_cosm_rrt}
\end{align}
Additionally, Eq.  \eqref{eq.mpr_cosm_ttt} can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq.mpr_cosm_ttt}
  \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} \right) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ddot{a} + C a = 0.
\end{equation}

We shall distinguish the cases \(C\) positive, negative and zero. Moreover, 
we parametrise the constant as
\begin{equation*}
  C = 
  \begin{cases}
    \omega^2 & \text{ for } C>0 \\
    \omega=0 & \text{ for } C=0 \\
    - \omega^2 & \text{ for } C<0 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Case \(C = \omega = 0\)}
\label{sec:org8bb7da8}

The solutions to Eq.  \eqref{eq.mpr_cosm_ttt} are linear polynomials in
\(t\), \(a(t) = A t + B\). Equation  \eqref{eq.mpr_cosm_rrt} is then
satisfied  iff \(A(A^2 + \kappa) = 0\). Therefore, there are three
real solutions to these equations---notice that there is no constraint
in the value of the parameter \(B\)---,
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = 
  \begin{cases}
  \pm t + B & \kappa = -1 \\
  B & \text{arbitrary } \kappa
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
For \(A = 0\), the value of \(\kappa\) is irrelevant, and we obtain the
standard Minkowski, de Sitter and Anti de Sitter solutions. 

Otherwise, \(A = \pm 1\) and \(\kappa\) is required to be minus one, by
the reality of the solution. These two solutions have \emph\{line
element\}
\begin{equation}
  ds^2 = - dt^2 + (B \pm t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 + r^2} + r^2 d\Omega_{(2)}^2 \right).
\end{equation}
The aforementioned solutions are known to be isomorphic to the inner
sector of the future (equiv. past) light cone. This can be seen after
a change of coordinates, 
\begin{align*}
  ds^2
  & = - dt^2 + (B \pm t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 + r^2} + r^2
  d\Omega_{(2)}^2 \right)
  \\
  & = - dt^{\prime2} + t^{\prime2} \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 + r^2} + r^2
  d\Omega_{(2)}^2 \right)
  \\
  & = - dt^{\prime2} + t^{\prime2} \left( {d\chi^2} + \sinh^2 (\chi)
  d\Omega_{(2)}^2 \right)
  \\
  & = - dT^{2} +  {dR^2} + R^2 d\Omega_{(2)}^2 
\end{align*}

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
      axis x line = middle,
      axis y line = middle,
      xlabel = $R$,
      ylabel = $T$,
      ymin=-1, ymax=5,
    ]
    \addplot [name path=A, black] {x};
    \addplot [name path=B, black] {-x};
    \addplot [name path=C, white] {6};
    \addplot [orange] fill between  [of= A and C, soft clip={domain=0:5}];
    \foreach \i in {1,2,...,5} {\addplot [domain=-2:2,blue] ({\i * sinh(x)}, {\i * cosh(x)}); }
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsubsection{Case \(C = - \omega^2 < 0\)}
\label{sec:orgb4ff773}
In this case, the Eq.  \eqref{eq.mpr_cosm_ttt} is solved by the
functions of the form,
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = A \exp(\omega t) + B \exp( - \omega t).
\end{equation}
Using the above form of the scale factor, Eq.  \eqref{eq.mpr_cosm_rrt}
yields the constraint,
\begin{equation}
  \omega ( \kappa - 4 A B \omega^2 ) ( A \exp(\omega t) - B \exp( - \omega t) ) = 0.
\end{equation}

The above equation requires that \(( \kappa - 4 A B \omega^2 ) =
0\). Since \(\omega^2 > 0\), the possible solutions of this equation
are characterised by the quadrant (or axis) on the \(A-B\)-plane, on
which the solution lies.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Either \(A \lor B\) vanishes
\label{sec:orgf8fecb7}

This requires that \(\kappa = 0\), and the scale factor is 
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = 
  \begin{cases}
    A \exp(\omega t) \\
    A \exp( - \omega t)
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\item \(A \land B \in \{QI, QIII\}\)
\label{sec:orge7e7a61}

If \(A \land B\) lie in the first and third quadrant, the reality of
the solutions requires that \(\kappa = 1\), and thus
\begin{equation}
  A B = \frac{1}{4 \omega^2}.
\end{equation}

The general scale factor for this case is
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = A \left( \exp(\omega t) + \frac{1}{4 A^2 \omega^2} \exp( - \omega t) \right),
\end{equation}
however, one can fix the initial time such that in that frame \(A = B\),\footnote{It is achieved by setting \(t_0 = - \frac{2}{\omega} \ln(2 A \omega)\).} in which all factor are
determined,
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = \pm \frac{\cosh(\omega t)}{2 \omega}.
\end{equation}

\item \(A \land B \in \{QII, QIV\}\)
\label{sec:org712f33c}

Similarly to the previous case if \(A \land B\) lie in the second and
fourth quadrant, the reality of the solutions requires that 
\(\kappa = -1\), and thus
\begin{equation}
  A B = - \frac{1}{4 \omega^2}.
\end{equation}
By setting the initial time such that \(B = - A\), the scale factor is
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = \pm \frac{\sinh(\omega t)}{2 \omega}.
\end{equation}

\item \textbf{Summary}
\label{sec:orgc6418b4}

All of these solutions are known to be vacuum solutions of General Relativity.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Case \(C = \omega^2 > 0\)}
\label{sec:org4d033dd}
From Eq.  \eqref{eq.mpr_cosm_ttt}, the possible solutions are of the
form
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = A \sin(\omega t) + B \cos(\omega t).
\end{equation}
Equation  \eqref{eq.mpr_cosm_rrt} requires that
\begin{equation}
  \omega ( \kappa + \omega^2(A^2 + B^2)) (A \cos(\omega t) - B \sin(\omega t) ) = 0,
\end{equation}
which might have real solutions iff \(\kappa = -1\). 

Without lost of generality, the above equation can be solved by using
the parametrisation,
\begin{equation}
  A = \frac{1}{\omega} \sin(\varphi) \quad \text{and} \quad B = \frac{1}{\omega} \cos(\varphi),
\end{equation}
in whose case the scale factor becomes\footnote{A different parametrisation leads to \(a(t) = \frac{1}{\omega} \cos(\omega t + \varphi)\)}
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = \frac{1}{\omega} \sin(\omega t + \varphi).
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Summary}
\label{sec:orga7383a7}

These solutions are known in General Relativity.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Cosmological metric solution with parallel Riemann}
\label{sec:org53952d8}
Now that we showed that the solutions of the parallel Ricci equations
are equivalent to those of General Relativity, we turn our attention
to the Eq. \eqref{eq.SimpleEOM}. For the metric ansatz in
Eq. \eqref{eq.FRW_metr}, only an independent equation is obtained,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{2 \, \left(\frac{\partial\,a}{\partial t}\right)^{3} - a \frac{\partial\,a}{\partial t} \frac{\partial^2\,a}{\partial t ^ 2} - a^{2} \frac{\partial^3\,a}{\partial t ^ 3} + 2 \, k \frac{\partial\,a}{\partial t}}{a} = 0,
\end{equation*}
which can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  - \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} + \frac{\dot{a}^2}{a^2} + \frac{\kappa}{a^2} \right) = 0.
\end{equation}
Interestingly, we have a single field equation that should determine
the scale factor. However, this equation is nonlinear, so the
uniqueness of the solution is not assured.

Therefore, we focus in solving the equation
\begin{equation}
  a \ddot{a} + \dot{a}^2 + \kappa + C \, a^2 = 0.
  \label{eq.prim_cosm}
\end{equation}
For such a task, we propose a Frobenius series for the scale factor,
\begin{equation}
  a(t) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k \, t^{\alpha + k},
\end{equation}
where the factor \(\alpha\), determined by solving the leading order
contribution of \(t\) in Eq. \eqref{eq.prim_cosm}, is either \(0\) or \(1/2\). 


\subsubsection{Another strategy: cheating!}
\label{sec:org84e1e21}
We would like to show that, at least some of, the solutions of
Einsteins equations with matter, solve the Eq. \eqref{eq.SimpleEOM}. For
that end, we take the Friedmann equations from General Relativity and
use Eq. \eqref{eq.prim_cosm} and look for solutions of the scale
factor.

The Einstein equations for the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker ansatz
are\footnote{From \(R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R + \Lambda
g_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G_N T_{\mu\nu}\)}
\begin{align}
  3 \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^2 + 3 \frac{\kappa}{a^2}
  & = 8 \pi G_N \rho + \Lambda,
  \label{eq.FRW00}
  \\
  2 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} + \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^2 +
  \frac{\kappa}{a^2}
  & = - 8 \pi G_N p + \Lambda.
  \label{eq.FRW11}
\end{align}
Using Eq. \eqref{eq.prim_cosm} the above can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
  \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} - C & = - 8 \pi G_N p + \Lambda
  \\
  3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} + 3 C & = - 8 \pi G_N \rho - \Lambda
\end{align}
or
\begin{align}
  6 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} & = - 8 \pi G_N (\rho + 3 p) + 2 \Lambda,
  \label{eq.prim_rw1}
  \\
  6 C & = - 8 \pi G_N (\rho - 3 p) - 4 \Lambda.
  \label{eq.prim_rw2}
\end{align}

Equation \eqref{eq.prim_rw2} implies that \(\rho - 3 p\) cannot depend
on time. A couple of solutions are,
\begin{itemize}
\item \(p = \rho / 3\), which is the equation of state for \emph{hot
matter}. Moreover, in this case, the integration constant \(C\) is
related with the cosmological constant,
\begin{equation*}
  C = - \frac{2}{3} \Lambda.
\end{equation*}
\item \(\rho = \text{const.}\) and \(p = 0\), which is the equation of
state for \emph{cold matter}. Interestingly, for such case the
integration constant carries the information of the \emph{matter
distribution} energy density and the cosmological constant,
\begin{equation}
  C = - \frac{4 \pi G_N}{3} \rho - \frac{2}{3} \Lambda.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spherically symmetric metric solutions}
\label{sec.iso_metr_sol}
In Ref. \cite{castillo-felisola18_einst_gravit_from_polyn_affin_model}, it was shown that for an
spherically symmetric ansatz for the metric, a Birkhoff-like theorem
holds, and the functions involved in the metric do not depend on
time. After a suitable coordinate transformation, the isotropic metric
ansatz is
\begin{equation}
g = -A\left(r\right) \mathrm{d} t\otimes \mathrm{d} t +
\frac{1}{B\left(r\right)} \mathrm{d} r\otimes \mathrm{d} r + r^{2}
\mathrm{d} {\theta}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\theta} + r^{2}
\sin\left({\theta}\right)^{2} \mathrm{d} {\phi}\otimes \mathrm{d} {\phi}.
\end{equation}
Although the metric ansatz is just the one used by Schwarzschild, the
difference is that it is not intended to solve Einstein's equations
but Eq. \eqref{eq.SimpleEOM}.

The field equations turns to be
\begin{dmath}
2 \, r^{2} B\left(r\right) \left(\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial
r}\right)^{3} + 2 \, r^{2} A\left(r\right)^{2} B\left(r\right)
\frac{\partial^3\,A}{\partial r^3} + r^{2} A\left(r\right)^{2}
\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r} \frac{\partial^2\,B}{\partial r^2} - 2 \,
r A\left(r\right) B\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}^{2} - 4
\, A\left(r\right)^{2} B\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r} -
4 \, {\left(r^{2} A\left(r\right) B\left(r\right)
\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r} - r A\left(r\right)^{2}
B\left(r\right)\right)} \frac{\partial^2\,A}{\partial r^2} - {\left(2 \,
r^{2} A\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}^{2} - 3 \, r^{2}
A\left(r\right)^{2} \frac{\partial^2\,A}{\partial r^2} - 2 \, r
A\left(r\right)^{2} \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}\right)}
\frac{\partial\,B}{\partial r} = 0,  
\label{eq.isot_NL_1}
\end{dmath}
and
\begin{dmath}
r^{2} B\left(r\right) \left(\frac{\partial\,A}{\partial
r}\right)^{2} - r^{2} A\left(r\right) \frac{\partial\,A}{\partial r}
\frac{\partial\,B}{\partial r} - 2 \, r^{2} A\left(r\right)^{2}
\frac{\partial^2\,B}{\partial r^2} + 4 \, A\left(r\right)^{2}
B\left(r\right) - 4 \, A\left(r\right)^{2}  = 0 .
\label{eq.isot_NL_2}
\end{dmath}
It is worth noticing that the system of equations turns linear for \(A
= B\), and in this linear case, the solution of the system is given by
the well-known AdS-Schwarzschild solution, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
A (r) = 1 + \frac{c_1}{r} + c_2 r^2.
\end{equation}

Next, we check whether the non-linear regime of the equations can be
solved. A Frobenius power series is proposed for both functions,
\begin{align}
A(r) &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_k \, r^{k+\alpha} , \\
B(r) &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty b_k \, r^{k+\beta}.
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq.isot_NL_1} and \eqref{eq.isot_NL_2}, one gets the
conditions for the \emph{critical exponents}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\alpha ( \alpha - \beta) - 2 \beta (\beta - 1) &= -4, \\
\alpha \big[ \beta (\alpha + \beta) - 2 \beta - 4 \big] &= 0.
\end{split}
\label{eq.metric_exp}
\end{equation}

The solutions to Eqs. \eqref{eq.metric_exp} are presented in Table \ref{tab.metr_exp}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{tab.metr_exp}
Possible values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), which solve Eq. \eqref{eq.metric_exp}.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll|r|r}
Conditions &  & \(\alpha\) & \(\beta\)\\
\hline
\(\beta < 0\) & \(\alpha = 0\) & 0 & -1\\
 & \(\alpha \neq 0\) & 2 & -2\\
 &  & -1 & -1\\
\(\beta = 0\) & \(\alpha \in \R\) & 0 & 0\\
\(\beta > 0\) & \(\alpha \in \R\) & inconsistent & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Schwarzschild-like solution}
\label{sec:orgfe545e2}

Consider the power series for the functions \(A\) and \(B\), with \(\alpha
= \beta = -1\). The substitution of \eqref{eq.metric_exp} into
Eqs. \eqref{eq.isot_NL_1} and \eqref{eq.isot_NL_2} yields the following
relation between the firsts expansion coefficients,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a_1 &= \frac{ a_0 }{ b_0 } & b_1 &= 1 \\
a_2 &= 0 & b_2 &= 0 \\
a_3 &= \text{undetermined} & b_3 &= \text{undetermined} \\
a_4 &= \frac{ a_3 b_0 - a_0 b_3 }{ b_0^2 } & b_{4} &= \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{b_{3}}{b_{0}}-\frac{a_{3}}{a_{0}}\right) \\
a_5 &= \frac{9}{20} \frac{ (a_{0} b_{3}-a_{3} b_{0})}{ b_{0}^3} & b_5 &= \frac{5}{4} \frac{ a_{3} b_{0} - a_{0} b_{3}}{ a_{0} b_{0}^2} \\
&\vdots & &\vdots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Notice that the series are determined once the values of the
coefficients \(a_0\), \(b_0\), \(a_3\) and \(b_3\) are fixed. Additionally,
the series truncate (as expected) for \(a_0 = b_0\) and \(a_3 = b_3\),
case in which the physical interpretation of the parameter is well
understood, \(a_0\) is related with the mass of the physical object,
while \(a_3\) is related with the cosmological constant. However, for
other values of the constants it is not clear whether the asymptotic
structure of the spacetime characterized by this metric is well
behaved \cite{geroch13_gener}.

For the case \(a_0 = b_0\), the coefficients are
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a_{1} &= 1
&
b_{1} &= 1
\\
a_{2} &= 0
&
b_{2} &= 0
\\
a_3 &= \text{undetermined} 
& 
b_3 &= \text{undetermined} 
\\
a_{4} &= \frac{a_{3}-b_{3}}{a_{0}}
&
b_{4} &= -\frac{3 (a_{3}-b_{3})}{2 a_{0}}
\\
a_{5} &= -\frac{9 (a_{3}-b_{3})}{20 a_{0}^2}
&
b_{5} &= \frac{5 (a_{3}-b_{3})}{4 a_{0}^2}
\\
&\vdots 
&
&\vdots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The substitution \(a_0 = -2 M\), \(a_3 = \Lambda\) and  \(b_3 = \Lambda +
\epsilon\), the coefficients become,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a_{1} &= 1, &
b_{1} &= 1, \\
a_{2} &= 0, &
b_{2} &= 0, \\
a_{4} &= \frac{\epsilon }{2 M}, &
b_{4} &= -\frac{3 \epsilon }{4 M}, \\
a_{5} &= \frac{9 \epsilon }{80 M^2}, &
b_{5} &= -\frac{5 \epsilon }{16 M^2}, \\
a_{6} &= \frac{\epsilon  \left(70 \Lambda  M^2+9\right)}{390 M^3}, &
b_{6} &= \frac{\epsilon  \left(10 \Lambda  M^2-21\right)}{156 M^3}, \\
&\vdots &
&\vdots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which  \hl{it seems to converge, but I don't have Mathematica
installed in the computer to check it}

\hl{Expeculation:}
When \(a_3 \neq b_3\), it seems that we have an extra parameter
playing (partially) the role of cosmological constant.

\section{Lie derivative and Killing vectors}
\label{sec.Lie_der}
The usual procedure for solving the Einstein's equation is to propose
an ansatz for the metric. That ansatz must be compatible with the
symmetries we would like to respect in the problem. A first
application is seen in the Schwarzschild's metric, which is the \emph{most
general} symmetric rank-two tensor compatible with the rotation group
in three dimensions, an thus is \emph{spherically symmetric}.

The formal study of the symmetries of the fields is accomplish via the
Lie derivative (for reviews, see
Refs. \cite{yano57_lie,choquet-bruhat89_analy,nakahara05_geomet_topol_physic,mcinerney13_first_steps_differ_geomet}). Below,
we briefly explain the use of the Lie derivative for obtaining
ansatzes for either the metric or the connection.

The Lie derivative of a connection possesses an inhomogeneous part, in
comparison with the one of a rank three tensor. This can be written
schematically as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.Lie_Gamma}
\mathcal{L}_{\xi} \Gamma^{a}{}_{bc} = \mathcal{L}_{\xi} T^{a}{}_{bc} + \frac{\partial^2 \xi^{a}}{\partial x^{b} \partial x^c },
\end{equation}
where \(\xi\) is the vector defining the symmetry flow.

\section{Useful changes of coordinates}
\label{sec:org91bc3e9}

\subsection{three-dimensional Flat, Sphere, Hyperbola embedded in four dimensions}
\label{sec:orga509019}

\begin{equation}
  ds_4^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + dw^2.
\end{equation}

\begin{align*}
  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \pm w^2 & = \pm 1
  \\
  x \, dx + y \, dy  + z \, dz & = \pm w \, dw
  \\
  \frac{(\vec{x} \cdot d\vec{x})^2}{1 \mp r^2} = dw^2,
\end{align*}
where we have defined \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\), and \(\vec{x} \cdot
d\vec{x} = x \, dx + y \, dy  + z \, dz\).

Therefore, the embedding of the sphere and hyperbola can be stated as,
\begin{equation}
  ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + \frac{(\vec{x} \cdot d\vec{x})^2}{1 \mp r^2},
\end{equation}
It can be generalised to include the flat Euclidean space, which is
nothing but setting \(dw = 0\), by adding a parameter \(\kappa = -1,
0, 1\),

\begin{equation}
  ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + \kappa \frac{(\vec{x} \cdot d\vec{x})^2}{1 - \kappa r^2},
\end{equation}
which in spherical coordinates is written as
\begin{equation}
  ds^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1 - \kappa r^2} + r^2 d\Omega_{(2)}^2.
\end{equation}
