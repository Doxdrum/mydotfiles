\begin{questions}
\titledquestion{Different boundary problems}

\begin{parts}
  \part Find the potential of the field of a point electric charge,
  situated above an ideally conducting earthed plane $z = 0$, and
  calculate the density of the induced surface charges. Write down
  the solution of the first boundary-value problem for Laplace's
  equation in the semispace \(z \ge 0\).

  \part Find the potential of a point charge inside a layer, bounded
  by two ideally conducting planes $z = 0$ and \(z = l\), which are
  maintained at a potential equal to zero. Investigate the convergence
  of the series formed by the method of images, and demonstrate the
  possibility of a two-fold termwise differentiation of this series.

  \part Inside the bihedral angle of value \(\alpha = \pi / n\) (n an
  integer), bounded by ideally conducting walls, a point electric
  charge is situated. 
  \begin{subparts}
    \subpart Find the electric field produced by this charge.
    \subpart Find the potential if the boundary conditions are
    \(\phi(\varphi = \alpha) = 0\) and \(\phi(\varphi = 0) = \phi_0\).
  \end{subparts}

  \part Find the potential of an electrostatic field, produced by
  a point charge e inside an earthed sphere. Find the density of the
  surface charges induced on the sphere and write down the solution of
  the interior Dirichlet boundary-value problem for Laplace's equation
  inside a sphere.

  \part Repeat the previous for the exterior solution.
\end{parts}

\titledquestion{Green's functions}

Find the Green's functions for the Laplace equation in dimensions,
\(D = 1\), \(2\) and \(\ge 3\).

\titledquestion{Hollow sphere}

A hollow sphere of inner radius $a$ has the potential specified on its
surface to be \mbox{\(\phi(a) = V(\theta,\varphi)\)}. Prove the equivalence of the
two forms of solution for the potential inside the sphere:
\begin{parts}
  \part 
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi(x) = \frac{a ( a^2 - r^2)}{4 \pi} \int \mathrm{d}\Omega'
    \frac{V(\theta',\varphi')}{(r^2 + a^2 - 2 a r \cos \gamma )^{3/2}}
  \end{equation*}
  where \(\cos \gamma = \cos \theta \cos \theta' + \sin \theta \sin \theta' \cos( \varphi -
  \varphi')\). 
  \part  
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi(x) = \sum_{l = 0}^\infty \sum_{m = -l}^l A_{lm} \left( \frac{r}{a}
    \right)^l Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)
  \end{equation*}
  where \(A_{lm} = \int \mathrm{d}\Omega' \, Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\varphi') V(\theta',\varphi')\).
\end{parts}
