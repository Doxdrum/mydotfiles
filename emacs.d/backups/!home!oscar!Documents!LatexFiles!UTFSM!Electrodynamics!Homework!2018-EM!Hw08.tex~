\titledquestion{Diverse Green's functions for the D'Alembertian operator}

In the lectures, we show that the Green's function for the
D'Alembertian operator can be obtained through a Fourier
transformation of the wave equation. The aim of this assignment is to
work out three other possible Green's functions other than the
\emph{retarded} one.

\begin{parts}
  \part A point charge in $n$ Euclidean dimensions corresponds to
  Green's function \(G^{(n)}(x^1, \dots ,x^n)\), which satisfies the
  differential equation 
  \begin{equation*}
    - \partial_A\partial^A G^{(n)}(x^1, \dots ,x^n) = \delta(x^1) \cdots \delta(x^n).
  \end{equation*}
  The solution to this equation can be written as the Fourier
  transform
  \begin{equation*}
    G^{(n)}(x^1, \dots ,x^n) = \int \frac{d^nk}{(2\pi)^n} \exp(\imath k \cdot x) \frac{1}{k^2}.
  \end{equation*}

  Evaluate this, by making use of the exponential representation
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{1}{k^2} = \int d\lambda \exp( - \lambda k^2 ).
  \end{equation*}
  Express the answer as a function of $R^2 = x \cdot x$. Verify, as
  special cases,
  \begin{equation*}
    G^{(3)} = \frac{1}{4 \pi R} \quad \text{and} \quad G^{(4)} = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2 R^2}.
  \end{equation*}

  \part If we integrate the above Green's function over one
  coordinate, we obtain Green's function in one lower dimension,
  \begin{equation*}
    \int dx^n G^{(n)}(x^1, \dots ,x^n) = G^{(n-1)}(x^1, \dots ,x^{n-1}).
  \end{equation*}
  Check this explicitly for $n = 4$, and then in general, from the
  explicit answer in the previous problem.

  \part The 4-dimensional Euclidean Green's function in the first
  part, satisfies
  \begin{equation*}
    - \partial_A\partial^A G^{(4)}(x^1, \dots ,x^4) = \delta(x^1) \cdots \delta(x^4),
  \end{equation*}
  and is explicitly
  \begin{equation*}
    G^{(4)}(x^1, \dots ,x^4) = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2 (x \cdot x)}.
  \end{equation*}
  By making the complex replacement
  \begin{equation*}
    x^4 \to \imath t = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \exp( \imath (\pi/2 + \epsilon) ) t,
  \end{equation*}
  show that \(D_+ = \imath G^{(4)}\) satisfy the differential equation
  \begin{equation*}
    - \left( - \partial_t^2 + \nabla^2 \right) D_+(t, \vec{r}) = \delta(t)\delta(\vec{r}).
  \end{equation*}

  \part Show that 
  \begin{equation*}
    D_+(t, \vec{r}) = \frac{\imath}{4 \pi} \frac{1}{r^2 - t^2 + \imath \epsilon},
  \end{equation*}
  and its residue is
  \begin{equation*}
    \Res( D_+ ) = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \delta(r^2 - t^2) = \frac{1}{8 \pi r} \left(
    \delta(r-t) + \delta(r+t) \right).
  \end{equation*}

  The above result is quite similar to that found in class, but
  without further restrictions it has two terms, the retarded and
  advanced Green's functions. In the following, we shall repeat the
  procedure in class---to move the poles in the momenta space---to obtain
  the four Green's functions.

  \part From the above, we know that the Green's function for the
  D'Alembertian operator, in Fourier space is
  \begin{equation*}
    \tilde{G}(k) = \frac{1}{(\omega - |k|) (\omega + |k|)}.
  \end{equation*}
  Calculate the Green's function in the position space by extending
  the integral in \(\omega\) to the complex plane.
  \begin{subparts}
    \subpart Avoid the poles along the integration path by pulling
    them down the real axis, i.e.,\footnote{Hereon, \(\epsilon > 0\) and
      going to zero.}
    \begin{equation*}
      \tilde{G}_1(k) = \frac{1}{(\omega - |k| + \imath\epsilon) (\omega + |k| + \imath\epsilon)}.
    \end{equation*}
    What is the condition on \(t\) for the extra integral not to
    contribute?

    \subpart Avoid the poles along the integration path by pulling
    them up the real axis, i.e., 
    \begin{equation*}
      \tilde{G}_2(k) = \frac{1}{(\omega - |k| - \imath\epsilon) (\omega + |k| - \imath\epsilon)}.
    \end{equation*}
    What is the condition on \(t\) for the extra integral not to
    contribute?

    
  \end{subparts}
