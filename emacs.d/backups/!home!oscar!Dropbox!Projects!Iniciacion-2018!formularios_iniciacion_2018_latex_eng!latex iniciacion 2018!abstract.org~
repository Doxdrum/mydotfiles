:END:

The aim of this project is to explore the phenomenological
implications induced in particle and astroparticle physics, by its
interaction with generalized alternatives of gravitational
interaction.  The necessity of considering such scenarios is driven by
the lack of phenomenological understanding of the dark sector of the
Universe.

The goal is to discriminate between the considered models by comparing
their predictions with the accelerator or cosmological observations,
and search for a possible viable explanation to the dark
sector. 

# The aim of this project is to explore the phenomenological
# implications in particle and astroparticle physics, in models
# interacting with generalized alternatives of gravitational
# interactions. The necessity of considering this scenarios is driven by
# the lack of phenomenological understanding of the dark sector of the
# Universe.

# From the view point of fundamental interactions, in order to provide a
# (minimal) viable explanation to the dark sector---including dark
# matter and dark energy---, one needs to modify either the matter
# content of the particle model (with the possibility of even adding
# mediators of new interactions) or modifying the theory of
# gravitational interactions.

# On the one hand, the former approach has been explored extensively,
# given rise to an incredible amount of beyond standard model
# generalizations. However, none of them provide a phenomenologically
# consistent solution to the problem.

# On the other hand, the particularities of the model of gravity (as
# provided by the theory of General Relativity) when compared with the
# remaining fundamental interactions,[fn:1] have driven the community to
# search alternative models of gravitation, which might either be
# compatible with the methods used with the other interactions or
# solve (at least partially) the problem of the dark sector of the
# Universe. 

# In this project, the focus will be the study of particle and
# astroparticle physics phenomena, induced by the interaction with
# generalizations of gravity, and trying to discriminate between the
# considered models by comparing their predictions with the accelerator
# or cosmological observations.

Since the purpose of the investigation is to obtain (astro)particle
phenomenology, we will consider the matter content of the standard
model of particle physics, interacting with a /curved/ spacetime
through a gravitational interaction given by generalizations of
General Relativity.

Although the alternative models of gravity are abundant, we will
restrict ourselves to two types of these generalizations, known as
Lovelock--Cartan and Polynomial Affine Gravity. The first kind is the
model built up under the same precepts than General Relativity
(invariant under local Lorentz and diffeomorphisms, and yield second
order field equations), but allows existence of torsion, and the model
depends on the dimension in which is defined. The Polynomial Affine
Gravity is a model which assumes that the gravitational interaction is
mediated by the connection, and thus its action is built up solely
from the connection, however, it is known to have a sector in which
its field equations generalize those of General Relativity (in
vacuum).

The idea is to focus in finding the new possible interactions induced
in particle physics, by (for example) the process of dimensional
reduction of a Lovelock--Cartan model, or mediated by the
gravitational torsion, and so on; and then use those new interaction
terms to analyze their contribution to physical observables in
accelerator physics and cosmology. It is important to use both
accelerators and cosmological data, because with the former we could
bound the parameters of the models, and then use them to determine the
contribution in cosmology. This procedure might shed light in the
(partial) understanding of either dark matter or dark energy.
