\titledquestion{Multiplication tables}

\begin{parts}
  \part Find the multiplication table for a group with three elements
  and prove that it is unique.
 \part Write down the possible multiplication table of a group with 4
 elements. Is it unique? If not, How many different tables are there?
 Are these tables of Abelian groups?
\end{parts}

\titledquestion{Dihedral groups}

A \emph{presentation} of a finite group is a list of its generators, their
order, and whatever further relations are needed to specify the
group. The same group may have several presentations. For example, $D_3#
has the simple presentation
\begin{equation*}
  \bk{a, b }{ a^3 = b^2 = e ; bab^{−1} = a^{−1} }.
\end{equation*}
With two generators, $D_3$ is said to have rank two. $D_3$ is also
the symmetry group of the equilateral triangle. In general the
dihedral group \(D_n\) is the symmetry group of a regural polygon of \(n\)
sides, and its \emph{presentation} is given by
\begin{equation*}
  D_n = \bk{a, b }{ a^n = b^2 = e ; bab^{−1} = a^{−1} }.
\end{equation*}
