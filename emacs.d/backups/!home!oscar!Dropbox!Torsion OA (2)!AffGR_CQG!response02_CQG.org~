Dear Editor,

we have received the comments from the referees. Please find next the
list of changes encouraged by their suggestions and questions.

- Highlighted all changes (including those of the first revision) in blue.
- We include the comments about the boundary term, including the
  references suggested by the referee.
- We explain the reason why the fields \(\Gamma\), \(T\) and \(A\) are
  independent. 
- We added an appendix with the derivation of the equation of motion,
  and justification of the vanishing torsion truncation. It includes a
  short comment about the local free falling frame.
- We comment on the appearance of the term \(\frac{ \partial
  L_{matter} }{ \partial g^{00} }\) in Eq. (8)---the Newtonian limit.
- We explain that the object in Eq. (16) is not used to lower and
  raise indices, it is NOT a metric (it only looks like one).

Regards,
the authors.

* Referee 1

Dear referee, first of all we want to apologise for the lack of some
changes. We lost them in a bad dropbox synchronisation, and we are
sorry for not noticing it previously. However, we took this
opportunity to include more explanations in the points you mentioned.

- All the (nontrivial) changes were highlighted. Including those of
  the first review.
- We added the proper comment about the necessity of extra terms
  according with the boundary conditions:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  In order to assure that the
    variational problem is well-posed, one has to make sure there are
    no second-class constraints.  Otherwise, higher derivatives may
    appear and a Gibbons--Hawking--York like term would be needed to
    ensure the well posedness of the variational problem.  There are
    studies of the affine analogue to the Gibbons--Hawking--York
    boundary term.  We refer to the reader to
    Refs.~\cite{parattu16_bound_term_gravit_action_with_null_bound,
      krishnan17_robin_gravit, krishnan17_neuman_bound_term_gravit,
      lehner16_gravit_action_with_null_bound,
      hopfmueller17_gravit_degrees_freed_null_surfac,
      jubb17_bound_corner_terms_action_gener_relat}. In the present
    model, the existence of second-class constraints has not been
    proven yet.

- We explain the reason why the fields \(\Gamma\), \(T\) and \(A\) are
  independent, and thus their field equations are second order:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  The action in Eq.~\eqref{4dfull} depends on the fields and their
  first derivatives. This characteristic ensures that the field
  equations are (at most) second order differential equations. Notice
  that these are second order equations for the irreducible components
  of connection.
  #+END_EXPORT
- We added an appendix (new appendix B) with the derivation of the equation of motion,
  and justification of the vanishing torsion truncation. It includes a
  short comment about the local free falling frame.
- We comment on the appearance of the term \(\frac{ \partial
  L_{matter} }{ \partial g^{00} }\) in Eq. (8)---the Newtonian limit:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  In Eq.~\eqref{NewtonPot} one can notice the explicit dependence
  of the \emph{geometry} with the matter distribution, through the
  term $\frac{ \partial\mathcal{L}_{\text{Matter}} }{ \partial
    \mathfrak{g}^{00} }$. This relates the \emph{mass of the body}
  with the generated gravitational potential.
  #+END_EXPORT
- We explain that the object in Eq. (16) is not used to lower and
  raise indices, it is NOT a metric (it only looks like one):
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  We would like emphasise that the geometrical object in
  Eq.~\eqref{geng}, despite the suggestive notation, is \emph{not} a
  metric. Therefore, we do not raise indices with such a
  construct. Additionally, although the object is not defined in the
  limit of vanishing torsion---as does the action in
  Eq.~\eqref{4dfull}---, it induces a nontrivial effect in the field
  equations of a scalar field, as will be shown in the following.

We expect to have fulfilled all your requests and answered your
questions.

The authors.
