** Description
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec.desc
:END:

Recently, there has been a lot of excitement in the physics community,
because of the experimental results which have detected, on the one
hand, the Higgs particle
cite:Aaltonen:2012qt,Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa, which was the
missing key ingredient of the standard model of particle physics, and
on the other hand, the accelerated expansion of the Universe
cite:Riess:1998cb,perlmutter99 and also the direct detection of
gravitational waves cite:Abbott:2016blz,Abbott:2017nmj. They represent
the triumph of technological development, as well as a milestone for
the theoretical modeling.

The success of the /modern physics/ stands on two theories, which
describe (quite accurately), what we believe are, the four fundamental
interactions in Nature. 

The standard model of particle physics covers three of these
interactions: Electromagnetic, Weak and Strong. It is a quantum field
theory, in which the interactions are modeled by gauge theories of the
\(SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\) groups, the fermionic matter
is modelled by fields transforming in the spinorial representation of
the Lorentz group \(SO(1,3)\),[fn:13] and moreover the whole model is
renormalizable. Although it is the most successful model in the realm
of particle physics, it lacks a consistent matching with the fourth
fundamental interaction, i.e., gravity. The (theoretical) achievements
of the standard model assume that the spacetime is flat, and thus
cannot agree with General Relativity. 

General Relativity describes the gravitational interaction
cite:einstein1915allgemeinen, and has passed most of the observational
test cite:Will:2014kxa. It is the only fundamental theory which is not
mediated by a gauge field, has not been consistently quantized (not
for lack of trying cite:Rovelli:2000aw), and does not enter into the
category of renormalizable theory. In addition, cosmological
observations suggest that the matter content of the Universe is
approximately twenty times bigger than what we observe, and therefore
that huge amount of missing matter (and energy) has been hypothesised
exist whilst been /dark/, in the sense that it is detected only though
their gravitational interaction instead of electromagnetic
ones. Nowadays, there is evidence of the /existence/ of the dark
sector. Unfortunately it is unknown what the constituents are, except
that they come in two pieces called dark energy
cite:Riess:1998cb,perlmutter99 and dark matter
cite:trimble87_exist_natur_dark_matter_univer.

The relevant fact is that we are able to measure the effects, but we
have no certainty of what is causing those effects. Of course,
hypothesise the existence of new forms of matter and energy is
suitable, as long as we are capable of (eventually) measure them. So
far, we do not have an explanation for what dark matter and dark
energy are made of. This lack of explanation made us wonder whether
there is a misunderstanding in our models, or they are incomplete, or
our precepts are incompatible.

The search of answers to these questions has open roads to considering
alternative models of gravity and particle physics (others than the
standard model). 

Notice that the proposal of the dark sector is a modification in the
side of the standard model of particles, while the gravitational
interaction is still modeled by General Relativity. An different
approach is to leave the standard model untouched,[fn:1] and
considering alternative models of gravity. In this project, we shall
focus in the latter, and shall analyse particular models of gravity.
Nowadays, there are lots of alternative models of gravity, but from
our view point only a handful of them appear as natural to be
consider.  

The first kind of model we are interested in, are models with general
connections. Einstein's model of gravity gives a geometrical meaning
to the interaction, by interpreting the curvature of the spacetime as
the responsible of the gravitational /force/. The model rely on the
fact that all the geometrical information of the spacetime is encoded
in the metric field, \(g_{\mu\nu}\). However, mathematically, the
curvature (\(R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\rho\)) is a geometrical quantity
defined in terms of the connection (\(\Gamma_\mu{}^\lambda{}_\nu\)),
and therefore the theory of Einstein can be generalised if one
considers a connection which is not defined (completely) in terms of
the metric. This was pointed out during the 20's by Cartan
cite:Cartan1922,Cartan1923,Cartan1924,Cartan1925, but was consider to
be relevant only when people started coupling fermions to
gravity. Cartan's generalization of gravity needs another field,
besides the metric, called the torsion (\(T_\mu{}^\lambda{}_\nu =
\Gamma_\mu{}^\lambda{}_\nu - \Gamma_\nu{}^\lambda{}_\mu\)).[fn:2]

The /minimal/ generalization of General Relativity introduced by
Cartan, however, it was consider a plausible physical model when
physicist considered gravity coupled with fermions,[fn:3] because the
fermionic matter density acts as source for the torsion. It was also
noticed that gravity could be thought as /almost/ as a gauge theory
for the Lorentz group[fn:4] cite:Kibble:1961ba,Sciama:1964wt. The
playground adapted to the study of these formulations of gravity is
the one of orthogonal frames cite:cartan2001riemannian, due to
Cartan. The usual action for pure gravity in General relativity,
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{equation}
  S_{\text{gr}} = \int \mathrm{d}^4x \, \sqrt{g} ( R + 2 \Lambda ),
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT
can be written in the new formalism as
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{equation}
  S_{\text{gr}} = \int \epsilon_{abcd} \big( \mathcal{R}^{ab} + \frac{1}{\ell^2} e^a \wedge
  e^b \big) \wedge e^c \wedge e^d,
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT
where the information provided by the metric is encoded in the
vielbien 1-forms, \(e^a\), the connection is changed by a Lorentz
connection 1-form[fn:14] (\(\omega^{ab}\)), and the objects
\(\mathcal{R}^{ab}\) and \(\mathcal{T}^a\) are the curvature and
torsion 2-form, defined through the structure equations
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{align}
  \mathrm{d} e^a + \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b & = \mathcal{T}^a
  &
  \mathrm{d} \omega^{ab} + \omega^a{}_c \wedge \omega^{cb} & = \mathcal{R}^{ab}.
\end{align}
#+END_EXPORT
It is worth noticing that in this formalism it is clearer that vanishing
torsion allows to define the connection as a function of the vielbein
(or equivalently the metric).

In the Einstein--Cartan theory the field equations for the torsion are
algebraic, an therefore the torsion can be integrated out and yields
standard General Relativity plus a four-fermion contact interaction,
whose phenomenology could---in principle---be tested in accelerators,
its suppressed by the gravitational scale, i.e., the mass of Planck
(\(M_{pl} \sim \SI{e19}{\GeV}\)), which makes impossible to observe
such effects. In order to obtain phenomenological interesting models,
one has to extend either the Einstein--Hilbert or the Einstein--Cartan
model.

A very interesting extension was proposed by Lovelock
cite:lovelock1969uniqueness,Lovelock:1971yv, who built the most
general action (in any dimension) compatible with the axioms
supporting General Relativity:
- Invariance under general coordinate transformations,
- Invariance under local Lorentz transformations, and
- Field equations should be second order partial differential
  equations.[fn:5]
The theories satisfying these conditions are known as theories of
Einstein--Lovelock, and can be written in terms of differential forms
as
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{align}
  S_{\text{EL}} & = \sum_{p = 0}^{[\tfrac{n}{2}]} S_{\text{EL}}^{(p)};
  &
  S_{\text{EL}}^{(p)} & = \int \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n}
  \Big( \mathcal{R} + \frac{1}{\ell^2} e \wedge e \Big)^{a_1 a_2}
  \wedge \cdots \wedge
  \Big( \mathcal{R} + \frac{1}{\ell^2} e \wedge e \Big)^{a_{2p-1} a_{2p}}
  e^{a_{2p+1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge e^{a_n}.
\end{align}
#+END_EXPORT
In four dimensions the most general action (up to
a topological term) is the Einstein--Hilbert action, but in higher
dimensional spacetimes there are nontrivial terms build with
polynomial curvature tensors.

The proposal of considering model with extra dimensions goes back to
the works by Kaluza cite:Kaluza and Klein cite:Klein, who found that
extending Einstein's theory to five dimensions, where the fifth
dimension is compact and tiny, yield to an effective four-dimensional
theory which /unify/ gravity and electromagnetism. Through the years,
the proposal got more adepts because the existence of those extra
dimensions could serve to explain deep conceptual troubles, such as
the /hierarchy/ problem cite:ADD1,RS1. However, it leaves the task of
compactifying the model and getting a plausible physical effective
theory in four dimensions, which has been extensively explored.

The Einstein--Lovelock theory is built with the Levi-Cività
connection, and we encounter the same limitations as in the
Einstein-Hilbert model, when trying to couple gravity with fermionic
matter. Therefore, it was proposed to consider a Cartan connection
cite:Mardones:1990qc. Nonetheless, the inclusion of torsional in
arbitrary dimensions allows terms with are not in the Lovelock series,
and that might induce interesting particle physics and cosmological
effects in the effective theory. There are four kinds of these terms:
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{R}_A & = \mathcal{R}^{a_1}{}_{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathcal{R}^{a_A}{}_{a_1},
  &
  \mathcal{V}_A & = e_{a_1} \wedge \mathcal{R}^{a_1}{}_{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathcal{R}^{a_A}{}_{b} \wedge e^b,
  \\
  \mathcal{T}_A & = \mathcal{T}_{a_1} \wedge \mathcal{R}^{a_1}{}_{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathcal{R}^{a_A}{}_{b} \wedge \mathcal{T}^b,
  &
  \mathcal{K}_A & = \mathcal{T}_{a_1} \wedge \mathcal{R}^{a_1}{}_{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathcal{R}^{a_A}{}_{b} \wedge e^b.
\end{align}
#+END_EXPORT
One of the goals of the project is to analyse in detail the
phenomenology of the aforementioned effective models, as for example
Ref. cite:castillo-felisola16_kaluz_klein_cosmol_from_five, where we
consider the effects in cosmology induced by the five-dimensional
Lovelock--Cartan theory (including the extra torsional term).

To some extent, we first shall compactify the Lovelock--Cartan
theories taking into account the nontrivial terms of the torsion. This
term have never been considered in the compactification procedure, and
we believe that they will source new phenomena which could be
observed. It is expected that the Kaluza--Klein tower of the fields
will correct the short-range behaviour of the interactions, but the
/zero modes/ will contribute to the dark matter density. Thus, we
shall analyse both the cosmological effects (expansion of the
Universe, rotation of galaxies, inflation, etc.), and /matter/ effects
(accelerator and cosmic rays phenomenology, neutrino physics,
etc.). On the other hand, the existence of new geometrical terms, in
the effective four-dimensional theory, could introduce novel
contributions to the vacuum energy, and therefore explain---at least
partially---the problem of the cosmological constant.

It is important to highlight that, using non-minimal introductions of
gravitational torsion there is room to explaining the dark sector of
the Universe
cite:Poplawski:2010jv,Poplawski:2010kb,Poplawski:2011xf,Vignolo:2014wva,alvarez-castillo17_dark_matter_candid_helic_effec,
and also accelerator phenomenology
cite:Belyaev:1997zv,Belyaev:1998ax,Belyaev:2007fn,Capozziello:2012gw,Capozziello:2013dja. However,
our proposal is based on a different approach, which might be called
quasi-minimal.[fn:6]

The second stream of our proposal is to further developing the formal
and phenomenological aspects of a novel model called /Polynomial
Affine Gravity/ cite:Skirzewski:2014eta. This model is built under the
premise of diffeomorphism invariance, and the solely field is the
gravitational connection.[fn:7] The interest in affine theories of
gravity goes back to the 1920's, with the works of Cartan
cite:Cartan1922,Cartan1923,Cartan1924,Cartan1925, Eddington
cite:Eddington1923math, due to the fact that the geometrical object
defining the curvature (as mentioned already) is not the metric, but
the connection. Although those early proposals were not fruitful,
along the years new affine models have been proposed
cite:schrodinger1950space,kijowski78_new_variat_princ_gener_relat,ferraris81_gener_relat_is_gauge_type_theor,ferraris82_equiv_relat_theor_gravit,poplawski07_unified_purel_affin_theor_gravit_elect,Krasnov:2007ei,Krasnov:2007uu,Krasnov:2007ky,Krasnov:2011pp,poplawski13_affin_theor_gravit,Skirzewski:2014eta,Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa.

One of the motivations to consider an affine model of gravity is that,
as for any other fundamental theory, it would be mediated by a
connection field. Moreover, there are innuendo pointing to the
possibility of quantize an affine theory of gravity. We shall restrict
ourselves to the Polynomial Affine Gravity proposed in
Ref. cite:Skirzewski:2014eta,Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa.

The action of the Polynomial Affine Gravity is given, in terms of the
irreducible components of the affine connection
\(\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} =
\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{(\rho\sigma)} + \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{[\rho\sigma]}

Some of the features of the Polynomial Affine Gravity are:
- The action is invariant under diffeomorphisms.
- The gravitational field is an affine connection, with torsion and
  non-metricity condition.[fn:8]
- The most general action has a finite number of terms, which makes it
  robust under the appearance of counter-terms in a (yet hypothetical)
  quantum version of the model.
- The nonexistence of three-point functions[fn:9] allows to bypass a no-go
  theorem imposed by causality and analyticity of the \(S\)-matrix.
- If the connection is a metric potential[fn:10] for a /spherically
  symmetric/ metric, there is a Birkhoff-like theorem.
- In the sector with vanishing torsion, \(T^{\lambda,\mu\nu} \to 0\)
  and \(A_\eta \to 0\), the field equations reduce to
  a generalisation of Einstein's equation, and are similar to the
  Yang--Mills equations,
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  \begin{equation}
    \nabla_\mu R_{\nu\lambda} - \nabla_\nu R_{\mu\lambda} = 0,
  \end{equation}
  #+END_EXPORT
  or in terms of the curvature (due to the Bianchi identity)
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  \begin{equation}
    \nabla_\lambda R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\rho = 0.
  \end{equation}
  #+END_EXPORT
  Notice that the above field equations are second order partial
  differential equations for the components of the
  connection. However, if one considers the connection to be
  determined by a metric, the field equations for become third order
  partial differential equations.[fn:15]
- In the torsion-free sector, the coupling with a scalar field yields
  to equivalent field equations to those of General Relativity, with
  the proviso that instead of a metric tensor, one only needs a
  covariantly constant, invertible, symmetric @@latex:
  \mbox{\(\binom{0}{2}\)-tensor}@@.

Despite all of these nice characteristics, there is still a lot of
possibilities to be considered when studying the Polynomial Affine
Gravity. The second stream of the project will be focus in analysing
those possibilities. Among them we mention:
- Finding solutions to the field equations, at least in the sector of
  vanishing torsion, which satisfy the cosmological or spherical
  symmetries. There will be metric and non-metric solutions. The
  latter are determined by the connection coefficients, which
  introduces the complication that the number of independent
  components increases much more that the number of available
  equations.
- Once the solutions are found, the following step is to narrow the
  physical consequences, in particular for connection driven
  solutions.
  - In the case of cosmological solutions, it would be important to
    determine the cosmic evolution: inflation epoch, Hubble parameter,
    accelerated expansion, and others. This will provide useful
    information when compared with the available cosmological data.
  - For the spherically symmetric solutions, it is worth to study the
    geodesics[fn:11] of matter, in order to compare with astronomical
    measurements coming from the Solar system and galactic scales.
- A proper way of coupling matter, other than scalar fields, is still
  missing. The correct formulation would become important for
  obtaining an admissible phenomenology of the cosmic evolution of the
  Universe. Particularly interesting would be to couple fermions,
  which (in the standard formulation) require a local Lorentz
  structure.[fn:12]

In summary, we propose to inquire two viable generalisations of the
known models for gravity, in order for deducing phenomena which might
be observed either in accelerator or in cosmological
experiments. Although the models seem to provide different kind of
phenomenology, the binding of the two streams would be a major goal,
pointing to the starting of a research branch of astroparticle physics
at the University.

** Hypothesis

The study of particle physics in the context of generalised models of
gravity will shed some light in understanding problems concerning to
particle physics, astroparticle physics and cosmology; as the
hierarchy problem, the cosmological constant, the missing of matter in
the Universe, sources of ultra-high energetic cosmic rays, /et cetera/.

** Goals

+ Analysing the phenomenology of the standard model of particle
  physics coupled with generalised models of gravitational
  interaction with non-symmetric connections and/or extra dimensions.

*** Specific goals

- Building particle models in gravitational backgrounds which
  generalise Einstein's theory.
- Analysing the cosmological implications of these models, as well as

** Methodology
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec.methodology
:END:

#+begin_comment
The methodology will be to consider alternative models of
gravitational interactions, which might shed light in the
understanding of the dark sector of the Universe. These alternative
models can be split in two groups: (i) A modification of gravity in
four dimensions, which does not require extra matter content, or not
as much as 95% of the total matter/energy, and (ii) A model of gravity
in scenarios with extra dimensions, whose effective reduction down to
four dimensions contain the additional fields required to explain the
dark sector. The two splittings will be consider in this project.

Although the alternative models of gravity are abundant, our target
will be a set of generalizations known as Einstein--Cartan (and its
Lovelock extensions), Lovelock--Cartan and the Polynomial Affine
Gravity. Among these theories, only the last one is defined in four
dimension, and it has several features which might be relevant if one
would be interested in a quantum theory of gravitation. The others are
build under the same requirements than General Relativity (in any
dimension), with the exception that torsion is not assumed to vanish
in the Lovelock--Cartan models.

The Polynomial Affine Gravity is a model built up from a connection,
without the aid of a metric field. It is worth mentioning that the
interaction is independent of the existence of a metric, so the
connection does not necessarily satisfy a metricity condition. It was
shown that---at least in the sector of vanishing torsion---, the field
equations are a generalization of those of General Relativity, and
being a theory for a connection, the equations are similar to those of
the Yang--Mills theories. We shall focus on the study of cosmological
models and the coupling of matter with this affine model of gravity,
as well as the phenomenology which might be observed in accelerators.
#+end_comment

A thorough analysis of the different models under consideration will
performed, by comparing their phenomenology with the available data
coming from both: accelerator physics and cosmology. This will allows
to discriminate between physically interesting models and /toy/
models.

The strategies to be applied in order to fulfill our goals include:
- Application of methods in differential geometry and field theory, in
  order for dealing with the models and its phenomenology.
  - We shall use also computational software which include: Sage
    cite:sage,sagemanifolds, Cadabra
    cite:Peeters2007550,Peeters:2007wn,peeters2007symbolic,
    Mathematica, CalcHEP, MadGraph, and others.
- To get involvement in some experimental collaboration. It will allow
  to get in contact with physicists with a different perspective,
  which enriches the attains of the project. Additionally, this would
  give us a quicker access to the experimental data.
- The strengthening of collaboration with researchers of other
  national and international institutions.
  - Academic stays will serve as initial approach to
    collaboration. Particularly for participating in an experimental
    collaboration, or to developing formal aspects of the project.
  - Attending conferences and workshops open new collaborative
    possibilities, and serve to communicate the obtained results.
- A closer work up with graduate students, as well as undergraduates,
  in physics and mathematics majors, who in the long term will become
  part of an astroparticle physics groups.

** Working Plan 
:PROPERTIES:

#+begin_comment
What is known as /modern physics/, developed during the last century,
stands on two pillars: the quantum theory of particles and Einstein's
principle of relativity. The major achievements of these pillar is the
built up of the Standard Model of particles and the theory of General
Relativity, which by them selves are the most successful models of
fundamental interactions. Despite their success, there are still
remarkable issues to be understood.

On the side of the standard model of particles one could ask oneself:
Why the Higgs is the only fundamental scalar field? How could the
stability problem of the Higgs potential be solved? Are there any
other fundamental interactions or families of fermions? Does
supersymmetry exists? Do we need to extend the standard model in a
nontrivial way?

On the side of gravitational interactions one could also ask: Why is
General Relativity the only theory of a fundamental interaction
without a consistent quantization program? Is there a natural
explanation to the hierarchy problem? What about the problem of the
cosmological constant? Why the 95% of the content of the Universe
manifests as dark matter and dark energy? 

Therefore, one sees that a mixture of the two pillars above does not
provide a complete description of the fundamental physics. In order to
move forward in our understanding of the fundamentals of physics, it
is necessary to change the models existing nowadays.

A vast number of generalizations and extensions of either the Standard
Model and General Relativity have been proposed, but satisfactory
solutions to the addressed problems are not yet found. Hence the
exploration of alternative models is a must.

The aim of this project is to continue such exploration, by

considered are Einstein--Cartan gravity (and its Lovelock extension),
Lovelock--Cartan gravity and the recently proposed Polynomial Affine
Gravity.

The major achievements of these pillar is the built up of the Standard
Model of particles and the theory of General Relativity, which by them
selves are the most successful models of fundamental
interactions. Despite their success, there are still remarkable issues
to be understood.

On the side of the standard model of particles one could ask oneself:
Why the Higgs is the only fundamental scalar field? How could the
stability problem of the Higgs potential be solved? Are there any
other fundamental interactions or families of fermions? Does
supersymmetry exists? Do we need to extend the standard model in a
nontrivial way?

On the side of gravitational interactions one could also ask: Why is
General Relativity the only theory of a fundamental interaction
without a consistent quantization program? Is there a natural
explanation to the hierarchy problem? What about the problem of the
cosmological constant? Why the 95% of the content of the Universe
manifests as dark matter and dark energy?

Therefore, one sees that a mixture of the two pillars above does not
provide a complete description of the fundamental physics. In order to
move forward in our understanding of the fundamentals of physics, it
is necessary to change the models existing nowadays. A vast number of
generalizations and extensions of either the Standard Model and
General Relativity have been proposed, but satisfactory solutions to
the addressed problems are not yet found. Hence the exploration of
alternative models is a must.

The aim of this project is to continue such exploration, by
analyzing in detail the particle physics phenomenology in models where
the gravitational theory is modified. The modifications which will be
considered are Einstein--Cartan gravity (and its Lovelock extension),
Lovelock--Cartan gravity and the recently proposed Polynomial Affine
Gravity.

*** First year
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec.year1
:END:

During the first year the focus of the project would be in model
building and developing of their formal aspects. In this phase, we
shall work in parallel the two proposals by first develop the
formalism to compactify Lovelock--Cartan models, and second solving
the field equations of the Polynomial Affine Gravity.

Along this period we will visit some of our collaborators, namely
Dr. Cristobal Corral (UNAM, Mexico), Prof. Aureliano Skirzewski
(currently in Uruguay) and Prof. Jorge Zanelli (CECs, Valdivia), and
also it will be important to contact two of the top academic leaders
on affine gravity, Prof. Kirill Krasnov and Prof. Nikodem
Popławski. The goal of the visits is to strengthen the collaboration,
while advancing toward the objective of getting phenomenologically
viable models coming from the studied frameworks. Additionally, the
contact with Profs. Krasnov and Popłaski will serve as a starting
point of collaboration.

In parallel, we shall continue the standard academic activities at the
University, which serve as link with the students---who will become
part of the future research group. Also, the majority of the current
collaborators are affiliated to the host Institution.

*** Second year
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec.year2
:END:

The goal is to achieve two milestones during the second year of the
project: (i) Completing the model building concerning the
Lovelock--Cartan models, and (ii) Finding a proper way of coupling
matter to the Polynomial affine gravity.

We expect to attend a few conferences/meetings/workshops, to present
our results and getting feedback from our peers. In addition, it would
be positive to revisit some of the collaborators to speed the
execution of particular tasks. If possible, the work with student will
turn into thesis dissertations.

Having in hand the result from the first year and (partially those
from)  the second year, we will start pushing toward the
phenomenological analysis of the models. Additionally, we shall start
contacting the experimental collaborations in which we would like to
participate.

*** Third year
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec.year3
:END:

For the last year of the project, we shall close the cycle with the
phenomenological consequences of the models studied during the
previous years. The central part will be devoted to astroparticle
physics effects.

At this stage we shall discern which of the built models are
realistic, and the presentation of our results in
conference/meetings/workshop will be a must. Complementary, we expect
to start attending meetings of the experimental collaboration we have
decided to join.

The work with the student should be starting to give its firsts
rewards, in terms of publications, thesis, attendance of
schools/conferences, et cetera.

** Work in progress
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec.progress
:END:

In the last 3 years, we have restrict ourselves to the study of the
phenomenology induced by the possible existence of gravitational
torsion. Our focus has been primarily in the Einstein--Cartan models
in five-dimensional spacetimes.[fn:16] We have published four articles
concerning with the phenomenology of these models
cite:Castillo-Felisola:2013jva,Castillo-Felisola:2014iia,Castillo-Felisola:2014xba,Castillo-Felisola:2015ema,
and currently one extra article has been sent to peer-reviewing
cite:RojasAbatte:2017vtq. 

Inspired in these models of gravity with more general connections, we
proposed a novel alternative of affine gravity, which correctly
describe the leading order of geodesic deviation, i.e. yields a Kepler
potential cite:Skirzewski:2014eta. Moreover, at least in a certain
sector of the model, it generalises Einstein's theory (considering a
purely gravitational system). This work is currently under
peer-reviewing cite:Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa.

Pointing to the cosmological effects of these models, we lately
consider a five-dimensional Lovelock--Cartan theory compactified on a
one-sphere, and analysed all possible effective cosmologies in the
four-dimensional effective model
cite:castillo-felisola16_kaluz_klein_cosmol_from_five. Interestingly,
some of the zero modes of the extra fields might account as dark
matter, the effective cosmological constant is driven by the /shape/
of extra dimension, and the new degrees of freedom could  possibly
generate an inflationary epoch.

Currently, we are working in several aspects of both theories, with
the aim of directing our results to the astroparticle and accelerator
phenomenology. Among them we mention:
1. Compactification of Lovelock--Cartan models on tori and spheres:
   A generalisation of the work performed in
   Ref. cite:castillo-felisola16_kaluz_klein_cosmol_from_five, where
   we expect to formalise the procedure, and obtain different
   behaviours to compare with the observations.
2. Addition of matter to the Lovelock--Cartan models: The above task
   is been done for a pure gravitational system, thus the coupling
   with matter is a crucial task to consider. 
3. Analysis of diverse sectors of Polynomial Affine Theory: In the
   same spirit that in Ref. cite:Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa, where the
   result where found in the sector of vanishing torsion, we are
   analysing other sectors, and their field equations.
4. Exact solutions of the field equations of Polynomial Affine
   Gravity: We are solving the field equations found in
   Ref. cite:Castillo-Felisola:2015cqa, with the aim of finding
   generalisations of cosmological and spherical
   spacetimes. Currently, we have found exact solutions but we do not
   have physical interpretations for them.

The Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María will be the host of the
project, providing the infrastructure and the salary of the
researcher. The group of High Energy Physics is in addition one of the
most important scientific group in the Country (and the unique with a
branch in experimental particle physics[fn:17]), and the collaboration
and exchange of ideas will raise the quality of our project.

Moreover, the Doctoral Program in Physics is a join endeavour with the
Pontifícia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, which has one of the
most prolific groups in Gravitation and Cosmology. This partnership
could lead to an enhancement of the goals of the project, improvement
of the research collaboration and developing of novel graduate
students thesis.

* Footnotes

[fn:17] The Institution collaborates with several laboratories world
wide, such as /Jefferson Laboratory/, /FermiLab/ and the ATLAS
experiment in /CERN/. The collaboration does not restrict to data
analysis, pieces of the experimental set up are manufactured and
tested in our facilities.

[fn:16] Under the premise that accelerator physics take place a region
where the curvature of the spacetime is negligible.

[fn:15] These equations were found in the context of building a
Yang--Mills-like theory of gravity
cite:stephenson1958quadratic,kilmister1961use,Yang1974. The fact that
these are third order for the metric, droves the community off from
this proposal.

[fn:14] Also known as the /spin connection/.

[fn:13] The Lorentz group is the subgroup of the Minkowski spacetime
isometries which stabilise the origin. The group of isometries is the
Poincaré group, \(ISO(1,3)\).

[fn:12] It might be possible to bypass this requirement with the use
of /world spinors/ cite:Hehl:1994ue,WorldSpinors.

[fn:11] In cases where no metric exists, the notion of geodesics
should be changed by self-parallel curve.

[fn:10] i.e. a Levi-Cività connection for a metric.

[fn:9] It is a feature of the classical model, however, the
/robustness/ of the action would assure the validity at quantum level.

[fn:8] Although the gravitational interaction is mediated by a
connection, the existence of a metric field is possible, but it plays
no rôle in the building of the action.

[fn:7] If one restrict oneself to the purely gravitational theory.

[fn:6] For example the Cartan's generalisations of Lovelock models is
/minimal/, in the sense that contains the same terms but the
connection is different.

[fn:5] Due to this last axiom, the formalism which suits the models is
the one of differential forms. The fact that the differential operator
is nilpotent implies that the action depends on the fields and its
first derivative, which the field equations are of second order.

[fn:4] Some proposals suggest that the natural way of interpreting
gravity as a gauge theory is by enhancing the group to the Poincaré
group cite:Blagojevic2002Gravitation,Blagojevic2013Gauge.

[fn:3] The extension proposed by Cartan, in a pure gravity model,
yields to the Einstein--Hilbert theory with vanishing torsion (imposed
by the field equations).

[fn:2] Although it is possible to describe the Einstein--Cartan
gravity with the metric and the torsion, it is customary to describe
it in terms of the metric and the connection as independent field, as
proposed by Palatini.

[fn:1] We consider that massive neutrinos are include in the standard
model of particles.
