\titledquestion{Relativistic Mechanics}

\begin{parts}
  \part We defined the proper time as \(d\tau^2 = - ds^2\). Find the
  rate \(\frac{dt}{d\tau}\).

  \part The Newtonian force is given by \(F^i = \frac{d}{dt} (m
  v^i)\). A relativistic equivalent should have the form \(K^\mu =
  \frac{d}{d\tau} (m u^\mu)\). Using the definition of \(u^\mu\), find the
  relation between the spacial components of the 4-force and the
  Newtonian force.

  \part Using that \(u^\mu a_\mu = 0\), find the zeroth component of the
  4-force, in terms of the Newtonian force. Additionally, show that it
  is given by the expression
  \begin{equation*}
    K^0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} \frac{d}{dt} \frac{m}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}.
  \end{equation*}

  \part The expression \(\frac{m}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}\) is usually called
  \emph{relativistic kinetic energy}, \(E\). Expand in terms of \(v\) to show
  that the first nontrivial dependence on the velocity coincides with
  the non-relativistic kinetic energy.

  \part From all of the above, it is possible to define the
  4-momentum, \(p^\mu = m u^\mu\). Defining the \emph{relativistic
    momentum} as \(\vec{p} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} \vec{p}_n \) where \(\vec{p}_n\) is the Newtonian
  momentum, find the relation between \(E\) and \(p\), i.e. the
  relativistic dispersion relation.

\titledquestion{Lorentz group and relativistic composition of velocities}

\begin{parts}
  \part State the mathematical definition of a \emph{group}.

  \part Does the set of rotations satisfy the axioms defining a group?
  Under what operation?

  \part Consider the set of boost along a single spacial
  coordinate, in the matrix form seen in class. Show that they close
  under the matrix multiplication. What is the relativistic
  composition of velocities?

\end{parts}

\titledquestion{Compton scattering}

\begin{parts}
  \part Consider a photon with energy \(E\) moving along the \(x\)
  axis. Write the 4-momentum, \(k\), for this particle.

  \part Consider an electron at rest. Write the 4-momentum, \(p\) for
  this particle.

  \part After the collision (scattering), the photon carries energy
  \(E'\) and moves in the \(x-y\)-plane. The angle of deflection (with
  respect to the original direction) is \(\theta\). Write the 4-momenta, for
  both the photon and the electron, in terms of the initial 4-momenta
  and the energy of the outgoing photon.

  \part Use the conservation of 4-momenta and that \(E = \frac{h
  }{\lambda}\), to obtain the relation
  \begin{equation*}
    \lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e} ( 1 - \cos( \theta) ).
  \end{equation*}
