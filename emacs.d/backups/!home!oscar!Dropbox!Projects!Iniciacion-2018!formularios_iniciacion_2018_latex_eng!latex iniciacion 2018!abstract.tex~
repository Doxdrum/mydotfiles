\section*{}
\label{sec:orga0fa285}

Describe the main issues to be addressed: goals, methodology and
expected results. \textbf{The maximum length for this section is 1
page} (Must use letter size, Verdana size 10 or similar).

\subsection*{Goals}
\label{sec:org84a7a7b}
The aim of this project is to explore the phenomenological
implications induced in particle and astroparticle physics, by an
extended gravitational sector.  The necessity of considering such
scenarios is driven by the lack of phenomenological understanding of
the dark sector (composed of dark matter and dark energy) of the Universe.

The goal is to discriminate between the considered models by comparing
their predictions with the accelerator or cosmological observations,
and search for a possible viable explanation to the dark
sector. 


\subsection*{Methodology}
\label{sec:org7fe86e6}
Since the purpose of the investigation is to obtain (astro)particle
phenomenology, we will consider the matter content of the standard
model of particle physics, interacting with a \emph{curved} spacetime
described by  an extended  gravitational model.

Among the abundant alternative models of gravity, we will restrict
ourselves to two types of these generalizations, known as
Lovelock--Cartan and Polynomial Affine Gravity. The first kind is the
model built up under the same precepts than General Relativity
(invariant under local Lorentz and diffeomorphisms, and yield second
order field equations), but in an arbitrary number of dimensions and
allowing existence of gravitational torsion. The Polynomial Affine
Gravity is a model which assumes that the gravitational interaction is
mediated by the connection, and thus its action is built up solely
from the connection, however, it is known to have a sector in which
its field equations generalize those of General Relativity (in
vacuum).

The idea is to focus in finding the new possible interactions induced
in particle physics, and our procedure is two folded. 

In the analysis of the phenomenology coming from the interaction
between the standard model of particles with the Lovelock--Cartan
theories of gravity, we shall proceed as follows: (i) Obtain the
effective interaction in four dimensions, after the dimensional
reduction; (ii) separate those interactions coming from the existence
of gravitational torsion, in order to discriminate the relevance of
torsion; (iii) use the data from accelerator physics to constraint the
parameters of the gravitational model; (iv) determine the cosmological
implications of allowing the constrained parameters.

In the branch of phenomenology of Polynomial Affine Gravity, we shall
follow: (i) Analyze in detail the sector of vanishing torsion, and
seek for solution of the field equations which are not allowed by
General Relativity; (ii) explore the cosmological implication of those
solutions not allowed in General Relativity; (iii) examine the
possible ways of coupling matter to the gravitational model, a subtle
issue without the introduction of a metric.

\subsection*{Expected results}
\label{sec:org0ae273f}
The scientific results expected include: (i) Obtaining effective
Lagrangians to describe the particle physics interacting with the
considered gravitational models; (ii) Restriction of parameters of
gravity by experimental data; (iii) Formulation of novel cosmological
models and their physical implication; (iv) Possible reinterpretations
of the dark sector of the Universe.

The expected products at the end of the projects include: (a) Six
completed paper, counting the published, in press and sent to
peer-reviewing; (b) collaboration with national and international
institutions; (c) participation and organization of international
scientific events; (d) Advisory of Master and/or Ph.D. thesis.
