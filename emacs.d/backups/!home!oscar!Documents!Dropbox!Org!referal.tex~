\section*{Review manuscript MPLA-D-18-00125, "Existence of Static Wormhole Solutions in \(f(R,G)\) Gravity"}
\label{sec:orgaeb5857}

In this article the authors consider particular choices of
\(f(R,G)\) gravity, in presence of certain models of matter fluids, to
analyse the possible existence of traversable wormholes.

In conjunction with the scientific appreciation of the paper, I would
like to address some issues about the format and presentation.

Although the formatting of the paper is not a point to evaluate, a
good format helps to get your message! Some comments are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item When I downloaded the paper from the server of MPLA, I got a file
with more than 1000 pages\ldots{} 20 of them the paper, and the rest
generated by bad formatting.
\item Therefore, I decide to check the arXiv version. That version is
available, but has problems with the labelling of equations and
references.
\item I found that the introduction was a very concrete presentation of
the problem to be analysed, but somehow the motivation to
considering wormhole solutions was weak. Despite the abstract
knowledge is interesting and important in itself, it is always
relevant to reveal your motivations to the reader.
\item While reading the paper, I found jumps in the order of references.
\item In Eq. (2), the field equations for a generic \(f(R,G)\)-gravity,
I'd suggest to change the names of the indices \(\theta\) and
\(\phi\) because those are used below to denote the spherical
angular coordinates.
\item I cannot find meaning to the following paragraph (beginning of
Sec. 3):
\begin{quote}
Although, the wormholes due to Schwarzschild solution are
non-traversable in both of the directions, but their existence
moved the related research to conceive the thought of traversable
wormholes formed by holding the wormhole throat open with the
exotic matter. Further, non-traversable wormholes include
Lorentzian wormholes [37].
\end{quote}
It must be restated.
\item After Eq. (12), the sentence
\begin{quote}
The violation of the energy conditions in the presence of exotic
has been the essential\ldots{}
\end{quote}
should be changed to 
\begin{quote}
The violation of the energy conditions in the presence of exotic
\textbf{matter} has been the essential\ldots{}
\end{quote}
\item The arguments in the paragraph below Eq. (15) are weak and
puzzling. In addition, it is not explained in what sense Eq. (15)
stops to be a choice and becomes a constraint.
\item In Sec. 3, most of the results are obtained numerically and shown
in plots. However, the size of the plot, their axis labels and
ticks is extremely small. It is hard to distinguish them.
\item A strong critic is the following. At the end of Sec. 3.3, one
finds the following:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{/home/oscar/Pictures/isotr_fluid.png}
\end{center}
together with the plots
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{/home/oscar/Pictures/isotr_fluid_plots.png}
\end{center}

Although there is no analytic expression for \(\beta\), the plot
shows a sort of exponential behaviour. It is not clear that
\(\beta - r\) is negative for \(r\) greater that 1 (the maximum
value shown in the plots). Moreover, the \(\beta/r\) is shown to
be a huge negative number, which increase (in modulus) as \(r \to
    \infty\). How come the authors claim that \(\beta/r \to 0\)?
\item The same critic is valid for the results of barotropic fluids. It
is strange that the authors change the range in \(r\) for each
subplot of Fig. 6, and these plots do not make clear the validity
of the stated conditions.
\item In my opinion, the plot in Fig. 7 are biased by the sampling of
the data. I'd recommend to use a different partition of \(r\), and
verify that the result is consistent with the one already shown.
\end{enumerate}


Based particularly in the points 10--12, I cannot recommend  this
article for publication.
