\section{Editor}
\label{sec:orgeb7f590}

Dear Editor,

we have received the comments from the referees, and encounter them
very useful to improve the understanding of the paper. Please find
next the list of changes encouraged by their suggestions and
questions (Notice that we include in addition individual responses for
the referees).

\begin{itemize}
\item We have corrected several grammar mistakes, and improved some
explanations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Referee 1}
\label{sec:orga194cec}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \uline{Minor points}: We have corrected the paper according with your
suggestions regarding the grammar. Concerning the addition of the
Gibbons--Hawking term, we have added the respective comment and
references. In addition, we have clarified the meaning of the
zeroth index in (former) Eq. 3.

\item \uline{what is meant by trace of torsion}: The trace is the contraction
of a lower and an upper indices, in the case of the torsion,
\(\mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}\), its trace would be either
\(\mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\rho\mu}\) or
\(\mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\mu\rho}\), which differ in a sign.

\uline{A definition of \(A\) in terms of \(T\) should be useful}: Such
definition is not possible because \(A\) and \(T\) are different
irreducible representations of the connection (specifically of the
torsion). If one imagine the torsion as a set of matrices, \((\mathcal{T}_\rho)^\mu{}_\sigma\), then \(A_\rho\) would be
proporcional to the trace of \((\mathcal{T}_\rho)\), while
\(\epsilon T\) would be the traceless part, i.e.,
\(\epsilon_{\rho\sigma\alpha\beta} T^{\mu,\alpha\beta} =
   \mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} - A_{[\rho} \delta^\mu_{\sigma]}\). Please notice that in this response we are not keeping a
careful normalisation of the trace nor symmetry of the indices,
however we have added correct definition in the manuscript.

\uline{does the condition \(\epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\mu\nu} T^{\kappa, \mu\nu} = 0\), imply that the Curtright field's cyclic permutation of the indices vanish?}:
Yes, indeed. We had mentioned that property explicitly in our previous
paper, and it could be mention explicitly.

\item \uline{Action presented in Eq.(2) needs more refine discussion}: It is
now explained that the curvature in the action is only of the
irreducible component of the connection which is symmetric in the
lower indices. As so, there is no relation between the curvature
and the Curtright, since the Curtright represent a different
irreducible component of the connection. 

As a clarification, \emph{second order} terms in the curvature will
appear, but we did not consider it because does not contribute to
the field equations (this issue has been stated in the body of the
paper). Nonetheless, no other higher order term of the curvature is
allowed, due to the lack of a metric to lower, raise and contract
indices.

Regarding the single derivative terms, they are similar to
three point interaction of non-Abelian gauge fields, appearing in
the electroweak sector of the standard model of particle physics.

\uline{Is it guaranteed that the field equations will be of second
order?}: The field equations for the connection will indeed be of
second order. It can be seen with ease form the Table 2. The value
of the \(c\) column represents the number of derivative in a
given term in the action. Notice that in principle we will have up
to four derivatives. However, the diffeomorphism invariance
requires that higher order derivatives enter antisymmetrized, which
leads to curvature terms. For example, for \(c=4\), we get the
Pointryagin-like densities\footnote{In general, unlike in the Riemannian case, we could have a
two-dimensional Pointryagin density \(R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\lambda\,
dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu\), in addition to the four-dimensional one.} or their products, i.e., 
\(R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\lambda
   R_{\rho\sigma}{}^\zeta{}_\zeta\,dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu \wedge
   dx^\rho \wedge dx^\sigma\) or \(R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\zeta
   R_{\rho\sigma}{}^\zeta{}_\lambda\,dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu \wedge
   dx^\rho \wedge dx^\sigma\), which at most lead to second order
equations. On the other hand, for \(c=3\) the diffeomorphism
invariance will lead to product of the curvature and the derivative
of the other fields. Such terms yield to second order differential
equations.

\uline{Interestingly it seems that by equivalence principle the action should vanish in local inertial frame and then by diffeomorphism invariance it should vanish in all frames}:
Perhaps we are misunderstanding the question but, to our knowledge
the equivalence principle (in mathematical terms) makes the
connection to vanish---in the \emph{free falling} frame---, however the
derivative of the connection should be kept (so not all of the
curvature effects can be watch out). Using  that definition of
equivalence principle the nonvanishing terms in the action are
those with coefficients \(C_1\), \(C_2\), \(E_1\) and \(E_2\).

Interestingly, your comment highlights the \emph{importance} of this
terms, which are precisely those entering in the perturbation of
the action, (former) Eq. (23).

The same will happen with your comment 8 (see below).

\item \uline{The definition of the (2,0) tensor in Eq. 7 is absolutely not
satisfactory}: We agree with your point, the introduction of the
Eddington inverse metric density relies solely in the fact that for
the action of Einstein--Hilbert, it really is the inverse metric
density. Although we used the same concept in our previous
paper---that's why it is in Section 2---, the point is that the
dimensional analysis in Appendix A shows that in our model the most
general symmetric, (2,0) tensor density built up from a general
connection, possesses the same components as the one derived from
Eddington's recipe. Please notice that in Sec. 4, when we couple
scalar matter, we use (former) Eq. (16) without mentioning the
variation used by Eddington.

\item \uline{In Newtonian limit, \(\Gamma^i_{tt} \propto \nabla_i \phi\),
having no connection to the matter Lagrangian}: We do not agree
completely with your view point regarding this statement. In GR the
importance of the geodesic equation is that it is the \emph{field
equation} for the point particle, and therefore related with the
matter Lagrangian. On the other hand, and the fact that
\(\Gamma^i_{tt} \propto \nabla_i \phi\) is due to the choice of the
metric ansatz to match the gravitational potential. Here, the
gravitational potential comes from the decomposition of the
connection.

\item \uline{Approach presented in the manuscript}: The field equations
obtained in the manuscript are restricted to the sector of
vanishing torsion. We argue that the sole nontrivial contribution
to those equations, come from the terms in the action which are
linear in the torsion. However, the field equations were studied
fully and we achieved the same result. We don't present the formal
derivation because it adds no meaning nor clarity to the
manuscript. Nonetheless, in future manuscripts we will use those
results to analyse different sectors of the model.

\uline{It is certainly not true that Einstein’s equations are about
vacuum solutions}: Right, Einstein's equations are not about vacuum
solution. However, we present firstly \emph{only} vacuum solutions
because as you have mentioned, it is difficult to couple matter to
affine models of gravity. That is the reason we believe Sec. 4
(Polynomial affine gravity couple with a scalar field) is
important, although it does not target setups like
Reissner--Nordström nor FRW, as you have pointed out.

We would like to highlight two points: (i) the difficulty of
inclusion of matter is due to the fact that the model does not rely
on the Lorentz symmetry, and thus the \emph{particles} should be
irreducible representations of the diffeomorphism group; (ii) our
model possesses solutions which do not exist in GR, it was briefly
mentioned at the end of Appendix C, that at the moment of
submitting this manuscript to the journal, we were analysing
\emph{exotic} Schwarzschild-like solutions. Moreover, the equivalent
\emph{exotic} FRW-like solutions might posses extra parameters, which
could be interpreted as contributing to the dark energy density of
the Universe. We are preparing a manuscript with these considerations.

\item \uline{how one interprets Eq. 15 in the affine formulation?}: Eq. (15)
cannot be written without using a metric field, due to the presence
of the Hodge dual. Nevertheless, the field equations for the
connection are Eq. (12) or equivalently Eq. (11). The critical
point is that as a metric exists in the theory, the action in
Eq. (15) yields to field equations for the metric. Those equations
spoil the niceties of the SKY model.

\item \uline{In local inertial frame the metric defined by the author vanishes,
so there is no matter in local inertial frame}: As argued in the
third item, in the local inertial frame the connection vanishes but
not its derivative. Therefore, the term coupled through the
\(\alpha\) constant is the relevant one in the local inertial
frame. In addition, at the level of field equation, that is the
only term which contribute in the sector of vanishing torsion.

\item \uline{Why \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) are not appearing in Eq. 8?}: Answered
in the previous point.

\uline{What are their physical significance?}: As you mention, the
significance of the parameter \(\alpha\) is clear in this context,
because it plays the role of the Newton's gravitational
constant. However, in the analysed sector the parameters \(\beta\)
and \(\gamma\) are innocuous and their meaning cannot be
extrapolated. We think that these parameter could be relevant for
the physical interpretation of (for example) the dark sector of the
Universe, once the model is analysed in a different sector,
i.e. with torsion.

\uline{Derivation of Eq. 20 is unclear}: First, notice that In Eq. (19)
there is a ``Ricci scalar'', defined as \(R_{\mu\nu}
   g^{\mu\nu}\). Moreover, all indices gymnastic is made with the aid
of \(g\) and its inverse. Using the Bianchi identity
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla_\alpha R_{\beta\gamma}{}^\lambda{}_\rho + \nabla_\beta R_{\gamma\alpha}{}^\lambda{}_\rho + \nabla_\gamma R_{\alpha\beta}{}^\lambda{}_\rho = 0,
\end{equation*}
and the the constancy of the tensor \(g\), it can be shown that the
(covariant) divergence of left-hand-side of Eq. (19) vanishes, and
thus consistency of the equation imposes Eq. (20).

\section{Referee 2}
\label{sec:org4ae6a08}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \uline{For the sake of clarity}: We have specified in the manuscript that
the covariant derivative in the action (2) is w.r.t. the symmetric
connection, i.e. \(\nabla = \nabla^{\Gamma}\), as well as the
curvature tensor, i.e. \(R_{ab}{}^c{}_d = R_{ab}{}^c{}_d(\Gamma)\).

\uline{Is the action (2), at least for a specific choice of the parameters, writable directly in terms of the curvatures for the full connection in (1)?}:
Although it would be desirable, under our assumptions all the terms
writable in terms of the full connection turn out to be topological
invariant.

\item \uline{What does `graviton' means here before introducing further
restrictions?}: Excellent question. Yes, you are right that there
is no clear equivalent to the graviton in an affine
theory. However, we are calling graviton to the spin two field
coming from the symmetric part of the connection, and not from the
torsion. Of course, that \emph{definition} is inherited from the
intuition gained in General Relativity.

\uline{why are such (three graviton) vertices not allowed?}: Sticking to
our definition, the tree level three-graviton vertices need terms
in the action which are quadratic in the curvature. As mentioned,
these terms are topological invariant, and do not contribute to the
equation of motion. However, they could play a role in the
definition of the real vacuum of the theory, in analogy with the
\(\theta\)-vacuum in QCD.

\item 


\item \uline{Why cannot one use the inverse of the Ricci tensor in its
construction?}: It cannot be used because it is not a tensor
density. 

\uline{Is there any restriction on the signature of the metric density?}:
No, in principle there is no restriction. However, one could
restrict the \emph{physical} parameter space by asking the ``metric'' to
preserve a signature. We have not thought about that yet.

\item \uline{About the solution of (former) Eq. (19)}: We say that (former)
Eq. (18) is a particular solution to (19) in the sense that such
solution does not consider the antisymmetrization. 

Concerning the introduction of the covariantly constant tensor, we
remark that it could (in principle) be other than the metric. The
constant \(\Lambda\) could be zero, and in that case we were saying
that the covariantly constant tensor is the zero 2-tensor, in whose
case the field equations cannot be written in the form of Einstein
but in the form of Ricci.

\uline{Is there any argument that restrict the signature of the metric in
Eq (19) to (1,3)?}: A mentioned previously, we have not analysed
(yet) the possible constraints that assure a certain signature in
the ``metric''. Currently we are working in that direction.

\item \uline{Instabilities: This conclusion is not uncontroversial}: We do
agree with your comment. Our goal is to hint the analysis of
physical degrees of freedom. The completion of the task is beyond
our current capabilities, and despite it is our desire to complete
the analysis, we comprehend that there are people which can
accomplish the study with ease.

\item \uline{Typos}: Thank you, the typos were corrected.
