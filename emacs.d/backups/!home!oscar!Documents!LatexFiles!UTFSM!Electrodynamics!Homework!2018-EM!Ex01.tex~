  The figure below shows three situations involving a charged particle
  and a uniformly charged spherical shell. The charges are given, and
  the radii of the shells are indicated. Rank the situations according
  to the magnitude of the force on the particle due to the presence of
  the shell, greatest first.

  The figure shows two square arrays of charged particles. The squares,
  which are centered on point $P$, are misaligned.The particles are
  separated by either $d$ or $d/2$ along the perimeters of the
  squares. What are the magnitude and direction of the net electric
  field at $P$?

  A small charged ball lies within the hollow of a metallic spherical
  shell of radius $R$. For three situations, the net charges on the ball
  and shell, respectively, are (1) $4q,0$; (2) $6q, 0q$; (3) $16q,
  12q$. Rank the situations according to the charge on (a) the inner
  surface of the shell and (b) the outer surface, most positive first.

  In the Figure, a particle is to be released at rest at point $A$ and
  then is to be accelerated directly through point $B$ by an electric
  field. The potential difference between points $A$ and $B$ is
  \SI{100}{\volt}. Which point should be at higher electric potential if
  the particle is (a) an electron, (b) a proton, and (c) an alpha
  particle (a nucleus of two protons and two neutrons)? (d) Rank the
  kinetic energies of the particles at point $B$, greatest first.

  The figure shows the path of a particle through six regions of uniform
  magnetic field, where the path is either a half-circle or a
  quarter-circle. Upon leaving the last region, the particle travels
  between two charged, parallel plates and is deflected toward the plate
  of higher potential. What is the direction of the magnetic field in
  each of the six regions?

  The figure gives, as a function of radial distance $r$, the magnitude $B$ of the magnetic field inside and outside four wires ($a$, $b$, $c$, and
  d), each of which carries a current that is uniformly distributed across
  the wireâ€™s cross section. Overlapping portions of the plots (drawn
  slightly separated) are indicated by double labels. Rank the wires according to (a) radius, (b) the magnitude of the magnetic field on the
  surface, and (c) the value of the current, greatest first. (d) Is the magnitude of the current density in wire $a$ greater than, less than, or equal
  to that in wire $c$?

  If the circular conductor in the figure undergoes thermal expansion
  while it is in a uniform magnetic field, a current is induced
  clockwise around it. Is the magnetic field directed into or out of the

\titledquestion{Energy of a steady current distribution}

In this problem, we shall derive the energy of a (steady) current
distribution, in an analogue way as done for a charge density.

Consider a current density distribution, \(\vec{j}\), leading a vector
potential, \(\vec{A}\). If one multiplies the current by a factor
\(\alpha\), the potential changes by the same factor.

\begin{parts}
  \part Show that is the current density increases from \(\alpha\) to \(\alpha +
  d\alpha\) in a time \(dt\), an electric field is created everywhere,
  \begin{equation*}
    \vec{E} = - \frac{d\alpha}{dt} \vec{A}.
  \end{equation*}

  \part What is the work done on those charges (in the current), by
  the generated electric field, per unit time? i.e. \(\frac{dW}{dt}\).

  \part Find the total internal energy, expressed in terms of the
  magnetic induction and also in terms of the current density.

  \part Consider that the current densities are given by a system of
  linear conductors. How is the energy of the system expressed? Use
  the Stokes' theorem to write it in terms of a magnetic flux.

  \part In the same way that the charge in a conductor was
  proportional the electric potentials, the magnetic flux is
  proportional to the currents,
  \begin{equation*}
    \Phi_i = L_{ij} I_j.
  \end{equation*}
  The \(L_{ij}\) are called coefficients of inductance, and the
  \(L_{ii}\) are the self-inductance.

   By considering a single current in the \(j\)'s loop, and
   evaluate the flux in the \(i\)'s one, show that
   \begin{equation*}
     L_{ij} = \oint_{c_1} \oint_{c_2} \frac{d\vec{s}_i \cdot
       d\vec{s}_j}{|\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j|}.
   \end{equation*}

   \part Since \(U_B = \frac{1}{2}L_{ij} I_i I_j,\) show that \(\delta U_\Phi
   = - \delta U_I\).
\end{parts}
