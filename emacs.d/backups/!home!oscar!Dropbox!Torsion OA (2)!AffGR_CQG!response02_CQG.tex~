\section{Editor}
\label{sec:org57d70ff}
Dear Editor,

we have received the comments from the referees. Please find next the
list of changes encouraged by their suggestions and questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Highlighted all changes (including those of the first revision) in blue.
\item We include the comments about the boundary term, including the
references suggested by the referee.
\item We explain the reason why the fields \(\Gamma\), \(T\) and \(A\) are
independent.
\item We added an appendix with the derivation of the equation of motion,
and justification of the vanishing torsion truncation. It includes a
short comment about the local free falling frame.
\item We comment on the appearance of the term \(\frac{ \partial
  L_{matter} }{ \partial g^{00} }\) in Eq. (8)---the Newtonian limit.
\item We explain that the object in Eq. (16) is not used to lower and
raise indices, it is NOT a metric (it only looks like one).
\end{itemize}

Regards,
the authors.

\section{Referee 1}
\label{sec:orgbe94777}

Dear referee, first of all we want to apologise for the lack of some
changes. We lost them in a bad dropbox synchronisation, and we are
sorry for not noticing it previously. However, we took this
opportunity to include more explanations in the points you mentioned.

\begin{itemize}
\item All the (nontrivial) changes were highlighted. Including those of
the first review.
\item We added the proper comment about the necessity of extra terms
according with the boundary conditions:  
\begin{quote}
  In order to assure that the
  variational problem is well-posed, one has to make sure there are
  no second-class constraints.  Otherwise, higher derivatives may
  appear and a Gibbons--Hawking--York like term would be needed to
  ensure the well posedness of the variational problem.  There are
  studies of the affine analogue to the Gibbons--Hawking--York
  boundary term.  We refer to the reader to
  Refs.~[53-58]. In the present
  model, the existence of second-class constraints has not been
  proven yet.
\end{quote}
\item We explain the reason why the fields \(\Gamma\), \(T\) and \(A\) are
independent, and thus their field equations are second order:
\begin{quote}
  The action in Eq.~(2) depends on the fields and their
  first derivatives. This characteristic ensures that the field
  equations are (at most) second order differential equations. Notice
  that these are second order equations for the irreducible components
  of connection.
\end{quote}
\item We added an appendix (new appendix B) with the derivation of the equation of motion,
and justification of the vanishing torsion truncation. It includes a
short comment about the local free falling frame.
\item We comment on the appearance of the term \(\frac{ \partial
  L_{matter} }{ \partial g^{00} }\) in Eq. (8)---the Newtonian limit:
\begin{quote}
  In Eq.~(8) one can notice the explicit dependence
  of the \emph{geometry} with the matter distribution, through the
  term $\frac{ \partial\mathcal{L}_{\text{Matter}} }{ \partial
    \mathfrak{g}^{00} }$. This relates the \emph{mass of the body}
  with the generated gravitational potential.
\end{quote}
\item We explain that the object in Eq. (16) is not used to lower and
raise indices, it is NOT a metric (it only looks like one):
\begin{quote}
  We would like emphasise that the geometrical object in
  Eq.~(16), despite the suggestive notation, is \emph{not} a
  metric. Therefore, we do not raise indices with such a
  construct. Additionally, although the object is not defined in the
  limit of vanishing torsion---as does the action in
  Eq.~(2)---, it induces a nontrivial effect in the field
  equations of a scalar field, as will be shown in the following.
\end{quote}
\item We include some of the comments in the previous response, in the new
manuscript, for example:
\begin{quote}
  We are aware that the use of this definition could be unpleasant or
  even ill-founded in alternative models to General
  Relativity. However, the dimensional analysis in
  Appendix~\ref{sec.im} shows that in our model the most general
  symmetric, (2,0) tensor density built up from a general connection,
  possesses the same components---but is not the same---as the one derived
  from Eddington's recipe. This argument allows as to proceed our
  analysis without mentioning the variation used by
  Eddington. Additionally, we clarify that none of this tensors will
  be used to raise indices, they will be useful only to contract
  indices.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  The significance of the parameter \(\alpha\) is clear in this context,
  because it plays the role of the Newton's gravitational
  constant. However, in the analysed sector the parameters \(\beta\) and
  \(\gamma\) are innocuous and their meaning cannot be extrapolated. We
  think that these parameter could be relevant for the physical
  interpretation of (for example) the dark sector of the Universe,
  once the model is analysed in a different sector, i.e. with torsion.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  An interesting feature is that the highest order in (covariant)
  derivatives, \(c=4\), yields the highest order in curvature. Such
  term generates terms related with (generalised) Euler and Pontryagin
  densities, and it has not been considered in the action, since it
  does not contribute to the field equations. Thus, the structure of
  the model restricts us to consider an action which is at most
  quadratic in the curvature.

  Regarding the single derivative terms, they are similar to
  three point interaction of non-Abelian gauge fields, appearing in
  the electroweak sector of the standard model of particle physics.
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

We expect to have fulfilled all your requests and answered your
questions.

Regards,
The authors.
