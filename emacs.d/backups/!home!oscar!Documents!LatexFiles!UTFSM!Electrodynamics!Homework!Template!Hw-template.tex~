\begin{questions}

  \titledquestion{Different unit systems}

  \begin{parts}
    \part Find the transformation relation between the SI and CGS units systems.
    \part What is an electro-static unit (esu)? What is a
    electromagnetic unit (emu)? How are they related between themselves
    and with the Si and CGS?
  \end{parts}

  \titledquestion{Continuous charge distributions}

  Using Dirac delta functions in the appropriate coordinates, express the following
  charge distributions as three-dimensional charge densities \(\rho(x)\).
  \begin{parts}
    \part In spherical coordinates, a charge \(Q\) uniformly distributed over a spherical shell of radius \(R\).
    \part In cylindrical coordinates, a charge \(\lambda\) per unit length uniformly distributed
    over a cylindrical surface of radius \(b\).
    \part In cylindrical coordinates, a charge \(Q\) spread uniformly over a flat circular
    disc of negligible thickness and radius \(R\).
    \part The same as previous part, but using spherical coordinates.
  \end{parts}

  \begin{solution}
    Here there is a solution.... Notice that is a \LaTeX\ environment!
  \end{solution}

  \titledquestion{Electric fields of charged spheres}

  Each of three charged spheres of radius $a$, one conducting, one having
  a uniform charge density within its volume, and one having a
  spherically symmetric charge density that varies radially as $r^n$
  with $n > -3$, has a total charge \(Q\). Use Gauss's theorem to obtain
  the electric fields both inside and outside each sphere. Sketch the
  behavior of the fields as a function of radius for the first two
  spheres, and for the third with $n = -2, +2$.

  \titledquestion{Charge distribution on a neutral hydrogen atom}

  The time-averaged potential of a neutral hydrogen atom is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi = q \frac{e^{-\alpha r}}{r} \left( 1 + \frac{\alpha r}{2} \right)
  \end{equation*}
  where $q$ is the magnitude of the electronic charge, and $\alpha^{-1} =
  a_o/2$, $a_0$ being the Bohr radius. Find the distribution of charge
  (both continuous and discrete) that will give this potential and
  interpret your result physically.

  \titledquestion{Energy of a charged system} %% of point particles}

  \begin{parts}
    \part Show that for a system of point particles the potential energy
    is given by
    \begin{equation*}
      U = \frac{1}{8 \pi} \int \left( \vec{E} \cdot \vec{E} - \sum_i \vec{E}_i^2 \right) dV.
    \end{equation*}

    \part Take \(\rho_t\) and \(\phi\) to be the final distributions of free
    charge and potential, respectively, after our system has been
    completely set up. If we had somehow decided to place a factor of
    \(\alpha\) as much charge everywhere, then our potential would be changed
    by the same factor \(\alpha\).

    By bringing the charge from infinity, a little bit at a time,
    i.e. \(\alpha\) go from 0 to 1, show that
    \begin{equation*}
      U = \frac{1}{8 \pi} \int \vec{D} \cdot \vec{E} \, dV.
    \end{equation*}
  \end{parts}

  \titledquestion{Capacitances of diverse systems}

  A simple capacitor is a device formed by two insulated conductors
  adjacent to each other. If equal and opposite charges are placed on
  the conductors, there will be a certain difference of potential
  between them. The ratio of the magnitude of the charge on one
  conductor to the magnitude of the potential difference is called the
  capacitance. Using Gauss's law, calculate the capacitance of
  \begin{parts}
    \part two large, flat, conducting sheets of area \(A\), separated
    by a small distance $d$;
    \part two concentric conducting spheres with radii $a, b$ with $b > a$;
    \part two concentric conducting cylinders of length $L$, large
    compared to their radii $a,b$ ($b> a$).
    \part Two long, cylindrical conductors of radii $a_1$ and $a_2$ are
    parallel and separated by a distance $d$, which is large compared
    with either radius. Show that the capacitance per unit length is
    given approximately by
    \begin{equation*}
      C \propto \ln \left( \frac{d}{a} \right)^{-1}
    \end{equation*}
    where $a$ is the geometrical mean of the two radii.
  \end{parts}

  \titledquestion{Energy change in a capacitor}

  Let \(\delta U_Q\) be the change in electrostatic energy of the system
  if the conductors are slightly displaced while the charges are held
  constant. Let \(\delta U_\phi\) be the change in electrostatic energy
  of the system of conductors if their displacement is the same as
  before, while the potentials are held constant. Then we will prove
  that \(\delta U_Q = - \delta U_\phi\).
