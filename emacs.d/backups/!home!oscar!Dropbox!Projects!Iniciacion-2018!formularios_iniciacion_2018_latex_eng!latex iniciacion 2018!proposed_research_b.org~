During the last two decades, the physics community has been witness of
very important experimental results in both particle physics and
cosmology. On the one hand, the missing ingredient of the standard
model of particles---the Higgs boson---, was observed independently by
two of the experiments of the Large Hadron Collider (ATLAS and CMS)
cite:aaltonen12_eviden_partic_produc_assoc_with,aad12_obser_new_partic_searc_stand,chatrchyan12_obser_new_boson_at_mass,
and on the other hand, the acceleration of expansion of the Universe
cite:riess98_obser_eviden_from_super_accel,perlmutter99_measur_oemeg_lambd_from_high_redsh_super,
and gravitational waves
cite:abbott16_obser_gravit_waves_from_binar,abbott16_gw151 were
measure for the first time, and well as the correlation of Gamma-Ray
burst with the merging of neutron stars
cite:abbott17_gravit_waves_gamma. These observations represent the
triumph of technological development, and a milestone for theoretical
modelling.

Nonetheless, the two pillars that support those achievements---known
as standard model of particle physics and standard model of
cosmology---are not enough to explain, from the theoretical point
of view the existence of dark matter and dark energy, their abundance
(dark matter and dark energy represent approximately 25\% and 70\% of
the content) in the Universe, the formation of large structures in the
Universe, the huge difference between the expected value of the
cosmological constant from a fundamental quantum field theory and the
measured value in cosmology. All of these questions join the
long-standing puzzles: Is there a consistent quantum theory of
gravity? Is the gauge principle fundamental? If so, Can gravity be
understood as a gauge theory?, /et cetera/.
