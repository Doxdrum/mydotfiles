** Present at meeting

- [X] Oscar (chair)
- [X] Marcela
- [X] Carolina
- [X] Juan Carlos
- [X] Ivan
- [X] Victoria

** Agenda

- Web-page of the school
- Definition of the lectures
- Applications to external funds

** Notes

1) We have considered that the dates of the school are to close to the
   /new year/, so it is a good idea to move the dates for the week
   after the /LHC Meeting/.
2) We have agree to have five sets of lectures, three lectures each
   (60 minutes by lecture)
3) The schedule would start at 9:00 am, with a coffee break in the
   morning and another in the afternoon
4) The topics of the lectures would be related to:
   - Standard Model
   - Cosmology (astroparticle)
   - Experimental (collider) physics 
   - Neutrino or flavour
   - QCD
5) The web-page has to be finished by <2017-04-18 Tue>
   - Needed for applying to grants
   - It is a priority
6) Applications for funds
   - CLAF :: Its deadline is April 20th
   - ICTP :: We still have some time
   - US_embassy :: We won't apply, only for the meeting.
7) We need to manage a budget
   - We expect 50 participants, 10 organisers and 5 lecturers.
   - Consider lunch for 70 people, plus two daily coffee breaks.
