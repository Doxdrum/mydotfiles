\titledquestion{Charge density of a point dipole}

A point dipole with dipole moment p is located at the point x0. From the properties
of the derivative of a Dirac delta function, show that for calculation of the potential
Ð¤ or the energy of a dipole in an external field, the dipole can be described by an
effective charge density
