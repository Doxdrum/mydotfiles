* Review manuscript MPLA-D-18-00125, "Existence of Static Wormhole Solutions in $f(R,G)$ Gravity"

In this article the authors consider particular choices of
\(f(R,G)\) gravity, in presence of certain models of matter fluids, to
analyse the possible existence of traversable wormholes.

Before commenting the scientific appreciation of the paper, I would
like to address some issues about the format and presentation.

Although the formatting of the paper is not a point to evaluate, a
good format helps to get your message! Some comments are:
1. When I downloaded the paper from the server of MPLA, I got a file
   with more than 1000 pages... 20 of them the paper, and the rest
   generated by bad formatting.
2. Therefore, I decide to check the arXiv version. That version is
   available, but has problems with the labelling of equations and references.
3. While reading the paper, I found jumps in the references.
4. The size of the plot's axis labels and ticks is extremely small.

** Scientific appreciation

I found that the introduction was a very concrete presentation of the
problem to be analysed, but somehow the motivation to considering
wormhole solutions was weak. Despite the abstract knowledge is
interesting and important in itself, it is always relevant to reveal
your motivations to the reader.
