\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

The Weinberg operator \cite{Weinberg:1979sa} is the lowest dimensional
non-renormalizable operator that one can write down with only standard
model (SM) fields. It violates lepton number by two units and thus, once
the electro-weak symmetry is broken, Majorana neutrino masses are
generated.  The observed smallness of the neutrino masses is then
usually attributed to the large value of the scale of lepton number
violation (LNV), typically $\Lambda \sim (10^{14}-10^{15})$ GeV. This
is the essence of the seesaw mechanism
\cite{Minkowski:1977sc,Yanagida:1979as,GellMann:1980vs,Mohapatra:1979ia,Magg:1980ut,Schechter:1980gr,Wetterich:1981bx,Lazarides:1980nt,Mohapatra:1980yp,Cheng:1980qt,Foot:1988aq}. While
simple and elegant, the large mass scale involved in this argument
makes direct tests of the classical seesaw impossible.

There exist, however, many possibilities to explain the smallness of
the observed neutrino masses with lower LNV scales. For Majorana
neutrinos one can write in general \cite{Bonnet:2012kz}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mnugen}
m_{\nu} \propto 
\epsilon 
\cdot
\left( \frac{1}{16 \pi^{2}} \right)^{n}
\cdot 
\left(\frac{v}{\Lambda}\right)^{d-5}
\cdot
\frac{v^2}{\Lambda} .
\end{equation}
Here, $v$ stands for the standard model vacuum expectation value
(vev), $d$ is the dimension of the operator, $n$ stands for the number
of loops at which neutrino masses are generated. $\epsilon$ expresses
symbolically the additional suppression of lepton number violation
that might arise in particular constructions, such as for example the
inverse seesaw mechanism \cite{Mohapatra:1986bd}. Finally, in
addition, small Yukawa or scalar couplings, not shown explicitly in
eq. (\ref{eq:mnugen}), could lead to smaller than expected neutrino
masses.

Eq. (\ref{eq:mnugen}) allows to estimate the typical scale $\Lambda$,
for which the observed neutrino masses could be explained for a given
$d$ and $n$. Fig. (\ref{fig:scales}) visualizes this estimate.  Here,
${\cal O}_5$ at tree-level corresponds to the classical seesaw
mechanism. Note that for ${\cal O}_5$ at tree-level (1-loop level)
Yukawa couplings of order ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$ (${\cal O}(10^{-3})$)
would be needed to obtain a scale as low as $\Lambda \simeq 1$ TeV.
In this figure we also show the estimated reach for three
colliders. The line denoted LEP reflects that no electrically charged
particle coupled to SM fermions with masses below roughly 100 GeV can
exist, after the negative searches performed at the LEP collider
\cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}. The grey area denoted LHC is a very rough
estimate of the reach of the LHC. The lower edge of the band is a more
conservative estimate (pair production of charged particles), while
the upper edge is roughly the reach of the LHC for particles produced
in s-channel diagrams and/or with colour.  For $d=9$ and larger one
expects that LHC experiments will cover an important part of the
available parameter space of these models. We also show as a dashed
line a rough estimate of the reach of a hypothetical $\sqrt{s}=100$
TeV collider, here called FCC. Thus, neutrino mass models generated at
$d=9$ and higher should be testable in the near future.  This simple
argument forms the main motivation for our current paper.

\caption{\label{fig:scales} The typical energy scales ($\Lambda$) for
  which a neutrino mass model with a given dimension and number of
  loops $(d,n)$ can explain correctly the observed sub-eV neutrino
  masses. Operators start at $d=5$, corresponding to the Weinberg
  operator.  Energy ranges have been estimated using couplings in the
  range of $[0.01,1]$. For higher-dimensional operators, say $d=9$ and
  larger, LHC is expected to test sizeable parts of the parameter
  space even for tree-level realizations.  For $d=13$ models the LHC
  can rule out nearly all of the parameter space of ``genuine''
  models.  A hypothetical $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV collider, here denoted as
  FCC, could test all models ``down'' to ${\cal O}_9$ at 1-loop. The
  classical seesaw type-I mechanism corresponds to ${\cal O}_5$
  tree-level and would require couplings of roughly order
  ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$ for $\Lambda$ in the LHC range.}

Here, we will study high-dimensional tree-level diagrams for Majorana
neutrino masses. We will treat systematically all possible topologies
for the deconstruction of the $d=9$, $d=11$ and $d=13$ operators. We
will identify all ``genuine'' diagrams. Here, we call genuine such
diagrams which can give the leading contribution to the neutrino mass
matrix, without the use of an extra (discrete or flavour) symmetry.
We will discuss this requirement in more detail in section
\ref{subsect:gen}.  Despite the large number of possible topologies,
for $d=9$ and $d=11$ surprisingly only 4 models survive: 2 at $d=9$
and 2 at $d=11$, respectively.  For $d=13$ we have found a total of 5
diagrams, corresponding to XXX-Y distinct models, since some models
produce more than one diagram.


Before presenting our analysis, let us briefly mention that, of
course, many authors have studied neutrino mass models beyond the
simplest tree-level seesaw, for a recent review see for example
\cite{Cai:2017jrq}.  The Zee model \cite{Zee:1980ai}, or the Zee-Babu
model \cite{Cheng:1980qt,Zee:1985id,Babu:1988ki} are early examples of
1-loop and 2-loop realizations of the Weinberg operator. A systematic
analysis of possible neutrino mass models at $d=5$ and 1-loop can be
found in \cite{Bonnet:2012kz}, for a general analysis of $d=5$ models
at 2-loop see \cite{Sierra:2014rxa}. For the 3-loop case, no
systematic analysis has been done so far, but there exist some
well-known 3-loop models in the literature
\cite{Krauss:2002px,Gustafsson:2012vj}. Neutrino masses at $d=7$ level
have also been studied. A systematic analysis at tree-level was done
in \cite{Bonnet:2009ej}. At $d=7$ tree-level there is only one (in our
sense) genuine neutrino mass model. This model was first discussed in
\cite{Babu:2009aq}, we will call it the BNT model below. A general
analysis of $d=7$ neutrino masses at 1-loop order was recently
presented in \cite{Cepedello:2017eqf,Cepedello:2017lyo}.

Then there are also some papers on $d=9$ (and higher) neutrino mass
models, see
\cite{Picek:2009is,Kumericki:2012bh,Liao:2010cc,McDonald:2013kca,McDonald:2013hsa,Nomura:2017abu}. We
will come back to these papers briefly in section \ref{sect:prelim},
where we discuss the main differences between their results and our
present work. We mention in passing also \cite{Nomura:2016jnl}, which
uses a scalar septet to construct a model giving $d=13$ neutrino
masses at 1-loop. Note, however, that this model \cite{Nomura:2016jnl}
is not genuine in our sense, since it uses a $Z_2$ symmetry to eliminate
the $d=5$ seesaw contribution.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section
\ref{sect:prelim} we will set up our notation and briefly discuss
neutrino mass generation at lower dimensions. This is necessary to
clearly define, what we mean by ``genuine'' models. Section
\ref{sect:class} then contains the central piece of our work. We
explain our methods, discuss topologies and list and briefly discuss
the genuine models.  In section \ref{sect:cncl} we give a short
conclusion. In the appendix we discuss, how experimental data on
neutrino masses and mixing can be easily fitted with these
high-dimensional models.
