\begin{abstract}
  We show that the effective field equations for a recently
  formulated polynomial affine model of gravity, in the sector of a
  torsion-free connection, accept general Einstein manifolds---with or
  without cosmological constant---as solutions. Moreover, the
  effective field equations are partially those obtained from a
  gravitational Yang--Mills theory known as
  Stephenson--Kilmister--Yang theory. Additionally, we find a
  generalization of a minimally coupled massless scalar field in
  General Relativity within a ``minimally'' coupled scalar field in
  this affine model. Finally, we present a brief (perturbative)
  analysis of the propagators of the gravitational theory, and count
  the degrees of freedom. For completeness we prove that a
  Birkhoff-like theorem is valid for the analyzed sector.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.intro}
A hundred years ago, A. Einstein presented for the first time the
correct field equations of his relativistic theory of gravitation,
known as General Relativity \cite{einstein1915allgemeinen}. It was
not only consistent with the available observations, but it also
predicted several effects that have been consistently observed and
measured---see Ref. \cite{Will:2014kxa} for a recent review---, being the
last one the confirmation of the existence of gravitational
waves \cite{Abbott:2016blz}. Thus, General Relativity has become the
most successful theory of gravitational interactions nowadays.

However, General Relativity seems to be an effective theory of a, yet
to be discovered, more fundamental description of gravitation. A first
hint was pointed out by E. Cartan, after remarking that the curvature
is not built up from a metric field but from a connection, and that a
part of it was left behind if one chooses to work with the Levi-Civita
connection \cite{Cartan1922,Cartan1923,Cartan1924,Cartan1925}. One could
also see this by considering Palatini's approach in General
Relativity, in which both metric and connection fields are treated as
independent, and noticing that generically the theory possesses terms
which do not appear in General Relativity (when it is coupled to
matter). In addition, we mention a few aspects related with the
quantization: First, the fact that within the standard formalism of
quantization, General Relativity is non-renormalizable
\cite{tHooft:1973us,tHooft:1974bx,Deser:1974cz,Deser:1974cy}, suggests
the theory can be thought as an effective theory. Second, the
Wheeler--DeWitt equations are not well-defined in general due to their
nonpolynomial dependence on the Arnowitt--Deser--Misner (or ADM)
variables
\cite{Arnowitt:1959ah,Arnowitt:1960es,WheelerGeo,DeWitt:1967yk,DeWitt:1967ub,DeWitt:1967uc}. One
of the most successful quantization methods of gravitational
interactions---developed from ideas by Gambini and Trias
\cite{Gambini:1980yz,Gambini:1986ew}, by Ashtekar
\cite{Ashtekar:1986yd,Ashtekar:1987gu}---, hints that a first order
formulation of General Relativity is not as complete as expected,
since the Lagrangian formulation should include an extra term known as
Holst term \cite{Holst:1995pc}. Finally, it is well known that once
matter couples to gravity (in particular fermionic matter), the
assumption of vanishing torsion in standard General Relativity is no
longer preserved as a field equation, and the best approach is to
consider Cartan's generalization of General Relativity
\cite{Kibble:1961ba,Hehl:1976kj,Shapiro:2001rz,Hammond:2002rm}.

Standing on the argument of the necessity of a quantum theory of
gravity, several generalizations of Einstein's General Relativity have
been proposed. One important class of these generalizations considers
the connection field to be independent of the metric, known as
Palatini type theories. Within this class of theories one finds the
generalization due to Cartan---which considers a connection with
nonvanishing
torsion \cite{Cartan1922,Cartan1923,Cartan1924,Cartan1925}---, but
also a broader kind of generalization which do not require the
metricity condition, see for example
Refs. \cite{Hehl:1976kj,Hehl:1994ue,Pagani:2015ema}. Another class of
generalizations is that in which the role of the metric as fundamental
field of the gravitational interactions is diminished or even
eliminated \cite{Eddington1923math,schrodinger1950space,Plebanski:1977zz,Capovilla:1989ac,Capovilla:1991kx,bengtsson1991cosmological,Krasnov:2006du,Krasnov:2007uu,Krasnov:2011up,Krasnov:2011pp,Delfino:2012aj,Poplawski:2012bw,Skirzewski:2014eta}.

Gravitational theories with a generic linear connections have degrees
of freedom which do not correspond to the expected massless
graviton \cite{Sezgin:1979zf}. Albeit these gravitational theories
with an arbitrary connection possess ghosts, there are examples of
well-behaved (stable) systems which have ghosts, such are the cases of
the Pais--Uhlenbeck
oscillator \cite{Mannheim:2004qz,Bender:2007wu,Smilga:2008pr,Ilhan:2013xe},
or the higher derivative supersymmetric quantum mechanical system
presented in Ref. \cite{Robert:2008}. The last sentence, allows to
argue that a model cannot be disregarded for the presence of ghosts
model, without a rigorous analysis of its stability.

In order to undertake the premises of incompleteness and
non-polynomial structure of the theory, in a previous
paper \cite{Skirzewski:2014eta}, we presented a polynomial (purely)
affine gravitational model in four dimensions built up entirely on the
basis of full diffeomorphism invariance. Worth to mention is that the
most general action built in this way contains only power-counting
renormalizable terms (which by no means guarantees the
renormalizability of the system). We showed that its non-relativistic
limit, around a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime, yields a geodesic
deviation\footnote{In this affine model there is not necessity of introducing a
metric, which implies that there is not geodesic. Nonetheless, we use
the term geodesic deviation to denote the deviation of the
self-parallel trajectory.} corresponding to the
generated by a Newtonian gravitational potential, despite the
existence of torsion. We also highlighted the possibility of using
standard methods to quantize the model, due to its polynomial
structure (unlike the earliest
proposals \cite{Eddington1923math,schrodinger1950space}), and also the
likelihood of avoiding the uniqueness of diffeomorphism-invariant
states from Loop Quantum Gravity programme \cite{Lewandowski:2005jk},
due to the absence of a fundamental metric, or in other words, the
absence of flux operators.

Interestingly, by construction, the polynomial affine gravity proposed
in Ref. \cite{Skirzewski:2014eta} has no explicit terms leading to
three-point graviton vertices, since all graviton
\emph{self-interaction} is mediated by non-Riemannian parts of the
connection. This feature might allow to bypass the general postulates
supporting the no-go theorems stated in
Refs. \cite{McGady:2013sga,Camanho:2014apa}, where it was proven that
generic three-point graviton interactions are highly constrained by
causality and analyticity of the \(S\)-matrix, and the only
\emph{acceptable} structure of the three-point graviton vertices is
the one coming from General Relativity.

The aim of this work is to show that in the vanishing torsion sector,
the field equations of the polynomial affine gravity are a
generalization of the Einstein's equations. The paper is organized as
follows. In Sec. \ref{sec.model}, we present briefly the polynomial
affine gravity model, and summarize the results obtained in
Ref. \cite{Skirzewski:2014eta} concerning the Newtonian limit of the
model. In Sec. \ref{sec.rlimit}, we restrict ourselves to the sector of
the theory with vanishing torsion, and find the field equations; which
surprisingly are a known generalization of the Einstein's field
equation. In Sec. \ref{sec.matter} we couple scalar matter to the model
of gravity. It is shown that (under certain considerations) some
solutions are given by a generalization of the minimally
coupled Einstein--Klein--Gordon system. In Sec. \ref{sec.propag}, we
present a brief (perturbative) analysis of the propagators of the
model, which allows us to count the propagating degrees of freedom. In
addition, we corroborate that result with a method equivalent to the
one by Dirac \cite{Diaz:2014yua}. Finally, in Sec. \ref{sec.conclusions}
we summarize and discuss the possible implications of the results. In
order to make the paper self-contained, we have included three
Appendices: In Appendix \ref{sec.DA}, we describe a dimensional analysis
strategy that allowed us to build up the most general action
consistent with diffeomorphisms invariance. In Appendix \ref{sec.Known},
we show a collection of known solutions to the effective field
equations of the model. Finally, in Appendix \ref{sec.Schw}, we
demonstrate---restricting ourselves to the vanishing torsion
sector---the equivalent of the Birkhoff's theorem of the theory.

\section{Polynomial affine gravity}
\label{sec.model}
First of all, we highlight that the model constructed below has as
only fundamental field an affine connection, and no metric field is
needed neither for contracting nor lowering or raising
indices. Moreover, in order to guarantee the correct transformation of
the Lagrangian density, the geometrical objects used to write down the
action will be the curvature and torsion of an affine connection,
\(\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}\), which accepts a decomposition on
irreducible components as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} = {\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} + \mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} = {\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} + \epsilon_{\rho\sigma\lambda\kappa}T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}+A_{[\rho}\delta^\mu_{\sigma]},
\end{equation}
where \({\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} =
\hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{(\rho\sigma)}\) is symmetric in the lower indices,
\(\mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} = \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{[\rho\sigma]}\)
is the antisymmetric part of the connection in the lower indices,
\(A_\mu\) is a vector field corresponding to the trace of torsion
(\(A_\rho = \mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\rho\mu}\)),\footnote{As clarification, we would like to mention that a contraction
of a covariant and a contravariant indices represents a
trace. Moreover, such contraction does not requires a metric tensor.} and
\(T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}\)---the traceless part of
\(\mathcal{T}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}\)---is a Curtright field
\cite{Curtright:1980yk}, satisfying \(T^{\kappa,\mu\nu } = -
T^{\kappa,\nu\mu }\) and
\(\epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\mu\nu}T^{\kappa,\mu\nu }=0\). Since no metric
is present, the epsilon symbols are not related by raising (lowering)
their indices, but instead we demand that
\(\epsilon^{\delta\eta\lambda\kappa} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} = 4!
\delta^{\delta}{}_{[\mu}\delta^\eta{}_{\nu}\delta^{\lambda}{}_{\rho}
\delta^\kappa{}_{\sigma]}\).

Therefore, the fields used to built the action are \(\Gamma\), \(A\)
and \(T\), which transform respectively as a connection, a vector and
a tensor density, under diffeomorphisms. In order to preserve
diffeomorphisms, the \(\Gamma\)-field cannot enter explicitly in the
action but through the covariant derivative \(\nabla\) (\(\equiv
\nabla^\Gamma\)), whose curvature is
\(R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\rho}\).

Using the above decomposition, the most general action preserving
diffeomorphisms is
\begin{dmath}
  \label{4dfull}
  S[{\Gamma},T,A] =
  \int\dn{4}{x}\Bigg[
    B_1\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\rho} T^{\nu,\alpha\beta}T^{\rho,\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}
    +B_2\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\sigma}{}_\rho T^{\beta,\mu\nu}T^{\rho,\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\sigma\beta\gamma\delta}
    +B_3\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\mu}{}_{\rho} T^{\nu,\rho\sigma}A_\sigma
    +B_4\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\sigma}{}_\rho T^{\rho,\mu\nu}A_\sigma
    +B_5\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho}{}_\rho T^{\sigma,\mu\nu}A_\sigma
    +C_1\, R_{\mu\rho}{}^{\mu}{}_\nu \nabla_\sigma T^{\nu,\rho\sigma}
    +C_2\, R_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho}{}_\rho \nabla_\sigma T^{\sigma,\mu\nu} 
    +D_1\, T^{\alpha,\mu\nu}T^{\beta,\rho\sigma}\nabla_\gamma T^{(\lambda, \kappa) \gamma}\epsilon_{\beta\mu\nu\lambda}\epsilon_{\alpha\rho\sigma\kappa}
    +D_2\,T^{\alpha,\mu\nu}T^{\lambda,\beta\gamma}\nabla_\lambda T^{\delta,\rho\sigma}\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_3\,T^{\mu,\alpha\beta}T^{\lambda,\nu\gamma}\nabla_\lambda T^{\delta,\rho\sigma}\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_4\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}T^{\kappa,\rho\sigma}\nabla_{(\lambda} A_{\kappa)} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_5\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}\nabla_{[\lambda}T^{\kappa,\rho\sigma} A_{\kappa]} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +D_6\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}A_\nu\nabla_{(\lambda} A_{\mu)}
    +D_7\,T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}A_\lambda\nabla_{[\mu} A_{\nu]} 
    +E_1\,\nabla_{(\rho} T^{\rho,\mu\nu}\nabla_{\sigma)} T^{\sigma,\lambda\kappa}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\kappa}
    +E_2\,\nabla_{(\lambda} T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu)} A_\nu
    +T^{\alpha,\beta\gamma}T^{\delta,\eta\kappa}T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}T^{\rho,\sigma\tau}
    \Big(F_1\,\epsilon_{\beta\gamma\eta\kappa}\epsilon_{\alpha\rho\mu\nu}\epsilon_{\delta\lambda\sigma\tau}
    +F_2\,\epsilon_{\beta\lambda\eta\kappa}\epsilon_{\gamma\rho\mu\nu}\epsilon_{\alpha\delta\sigma\tau}\Big) 
    +F_3\, T^{\rho,\alpha\beta}T^{\gamma,\mu\nu}T^{\lambda,\sigma\tau}A_\tau \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\lambda}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    +F_4\,T^{\eta,\alpha\beta}T^{\kappa,\gamma\delta}A_\eta A_\kappa\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\Bigg].
\end{dmath}
In Eq. \eqref{4dfull}, we have dropped all terms which can be related
through partial integration, and those which are topological invariant
(e.g. the Euler density). A straightforward dimensional analysis shows
the impossibility of other contributions into the action, see
Appendix \ref{sec.DA} (in particular Sec. \ref{sec.ld}). Interestingly,
the above action turns out to be power-counting renormalizable, which
does not guarantee renormalizability, but is a nice feature. The
structure of the model yields no three-point graviton
vertices---although the statement points to a feature of the classical
theory, due to the structure of the interactions this assertion would
hold at quantum level because otherwise there would be a breaking of
the diffeomorphism invariance---, which might allow to overcome the
\emph{no-go} theorems found in
Refs. \cite{McGady:2013sga,Camanho:2014apa}. It is worth mentioning
that all coupling constants are dimensionless, which might be a hint
of conformal invariance of the model \cite{Buchholz:1976hz}, and
further analysis of this invariance will be presented in
Ref. \cite{OCF-future3}.

In Ref. \cite{Skirzewski:2014eta} we analysed the \emph{geodesic deviation}
induced by scalar perturbations around a static, isotropic and
homogeneous solution in connection with a generic matter action. In
the rest of this section we summarize the procedure which leads to the
Newtonian limit of the model.

First, we considered a static, homogeneous, and isotropic expansion of
fields,\footnote{Notice that in the \(1+3\)-decomposition, the zeroth index
stands for the time coordinate.}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    A_\mu &= \delta_\mu^0 A + a_\mu, \\
    T^{\mu,\nu\rho} &= \delta^{\mu}_m\delta^{\nu\rho}_{m0}T + t^{\mu,\nu\rho},
    \\
    \Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu} &= E \delta^\lambda_0 \delta^m_\mu \delta^m_\nu + F \delta^\lambda_m \delta^m_{(\mu}\delta^0_{\nu)} +
    G\delta^\lambda_0 \delta^0_{\mu}\delta^0_{\nu} + \gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu},
  \end{split}
  \label{GammaExp}
\end{equation}
with \(\delta^{\mu\nu}_{\lambda\kappa}=\delta^{\mu}_{\lambda}\delta^{\nu}_{\kappa}-\delta^{\mu}_{\kappa}\delta^{\nu}_{\lambda}\). Next, by
analysing the first order perturbations of the actions, we found a
choice of the coupling constants which allows nontrivial solutions of
these field equations, together with the non-relativistic limit of the
geodesic equation. Then, we substitute the field components by their
scalar perturbation decomposition,
\begin{equation}
  a_\mu \to \delta_\mu^0 a+\delta_\mu^m \partial_{m}a_{\mathtt{L}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    t^{\mu,\nu\rho} &\to \delta^{\mu}_m\delta^{\nu\rho}_{n0} \Big(t \delta^{m n} + \partial^m \partial^n t_{\mathtt{L}} \Big)
    +\delta^{\mu}_0 \delta^{\nu\rho}_{m0} \partial^m c_{\mathtt{L}}
    \\
    & \quad + \Big(\delta^{\mu}_0\delta^{\nu\rho}_{mn}-\delta^{\mu}_m\delta^{\nu\rho}_{n0}\Big)\epsilon^{m n p} \partial_{p} b
    \\
    & \quad +\delta^{\mu}_m \delta^{\nu}_{n} \delta^{\rho}_{p} \Big(\epsilon^{n p q}\partial_q \partial^m d_1 +  (\delta^{m n} \partial^p - \delta^{m p} \partial^n)d_2\Big)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}
    &\to
    \delta^\lambda_0\delta^0_\mu\delta^0_\nu u 
    + \delta^\lambda_m \delta^0_\mu\delta^0_\nu \partial^m v_{\mathtt{L}}
    + 2\delta^\lambda_0 \delta^0_{(\mu}\delta^m_{\nu)} \partial_m w_{\mathtt{L}}
    \\
    & \quad + \delta^\lambda_0 \delta^m_\mu\delta^n_\nu \Big(x \delta_{mn} + \partial_m \partial_n x_{\mathtt{L}}\Big)
    \\
    & \quad + 2\delta^\lambda_m \delta^0_{(\mu}\delta^n_{\nu)} \Big(y_1 \delta^m{}_n + \epsilon^{m p}{}_{n} \partial_p y_2 + \partial^m \partial_n y_{\mathtt{L}}\Big)
    \\
    & \quad + \delta^\lambda_m \delta^n_{\mu}\delta^p_{\nu} \Big(\delta_{n p} \partial^m z_1 + (\delta^m{}_n \partial_p+\delta^m{}_p \partial_n) z_2
    \\
    & \qquad +  (\epsilon^{m q}{}_n \partial_p+\epsilon^{m q}{}_p \partial_n) \partial_q z_3 + \partial^m \partial_n \partial_p z_{\mathtt{L}}\Big),
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the ``\(\mathtt{L}\)'' sub-index identifies the longitudinal
degrees of freedom.

Albeit the inclusion of matter in a non-metric spacetime is a
nonstandard procedure, we assumed that the matter action would depend
on the most general, symmetric \(\binom{2}{0}\)-tensor density,
\(\mathfrak{g}^{\mu \nu}\), built up with the available fields. The
dimensional analysis in Sec. \ref{sec.im} shows that this tensor density
contains the same terms as what we call the ``Eddington's metric
density'',\footnote{Despite the suggestive name, this is a \(\binom{2}{0}\)-tensor
density which does not necessarily satisfy the metric
conditions. However, for the simple case of the Einstein--Hilbert
action, it is in fact the inverse metric density.} defined as the variation of the action with respect
to the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor (see
Refs. \cite{Eddington1923math,schrodinger1950space,Poplawski:2012bw}),
i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{metric}
  \frac{\delta\ }{\delta R_{(\mu\nu)}} S[\Gamma] \equiv \sqrt{\mathsf{g}} \, \mathsf{g}^{\mu\nu} = \bar{g}^{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}

From the geodesic equations and the linearized action on scalar
perturbation, we found that only a few terms in the scalar
perturbation affect the geodesic equation.\footnote{We cross-check our result using the software
Cadabra \cite{Peeters2007550,peeters2007symbolic,Peeters:2007wn} and
Cadabra2.} The effective
geodesic deviation is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{NewtonPot}
  \Gamma^i{}_{00} = - \frac{1}{8\pi} \frac{ \partial\mathcal{L}_{\text{Matter}} }{ \partial \mathfrak{g}^{00} } \, \nabla^i \left(\frac{1}{|\vec{x}|}\right),
\end{equation}
which is the usual Newtonian force induced by a massive source, where
we restricted ourselves to consider \(\mathfrak{g}^{\mu \nu} =
\bar{g}^{\mu\nu}\).

\section{Relativistic limit}
\label{sec.rlimit}
Despite we obtained the correct Newtonian gravitational potential in
the non-relativistic limit, see Eq. \eqref{NewtonPot}, a
\emph{post}-Newtonian approximation is necessary to explain
gravitational phenomena like Mercury's perihelion and the bending of
light by a gravitational source. Therefore, we should go beyond the
Newtonian limit in order to compare our model with General Relativity.

Even though a comparison between the models does not require the
imposition of vanishing torsion, for the sake of simplicity, at this
stage we shall focus on a sector of the theory in which the connection
is torsion-free. Notice that the vanishing torsion limit---equivalent to
take \(T^{\lambda,\mu\nu} \to 0\) and \(A_\mu \to 0\)---cannot be taken at the action level,
but in the field equations. Interestingly, the field equations from
Eq. \eqref{4dfull} can be consistently \emph{truncated} under such
requirements. It can be realized as follows, since only the terms of
the action linear in these fields will be relevant, one can consider
the effective action linear in the torsion's fields, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eff-action}
  S_{\text{eff}} = \int\dn{4}{x} \Big( C_1\, R_{\lambda\mu}{}^{\lambda}{}_\nu \nabla_\rho %T^{\nu,\rho\sigma}
  + C_2 \, R_{\mu\rho}{}^{\lambda}{}_\lambda \nabla_\nu \Big) T^{\nu,\mu\rho} ,
\end{equation}
and the only nontrivial field equation after the limit will be the one
for the Curtright, \(T^{\nu,\mu\rho}\),
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\rho} R_{\mu]\nu} + \kappa \nabla_{\nu} R_{\mu\rho}{}^\lambda{}_\lambda = 0,
  \label{almostSimpleEOM}
\end{equation}
with \(\kappa\) a constant related with the original couplings of the
model. Although it is strange to obtain the field equations for the
physical degrees of freedom varying with respect to the non-physical
ones, this behaviour is interpreted as a signal of the non-uniqueness
of the Lagrangian to describe a system \cite{SHcomm}. A simple
mechanical system which serves to illustrate the non-uniqueness of the
Lagrangian is the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, whose standard
Lagrangian is
\begin{equation*}
  \Lag_a = \frac{1}{2} \left( \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 - x^2 - y^2 \right),
\end{equation*}
but the alternative Lagrangian
\begin{equation*}
  \Lag_b = \dot{x} \dot{y} - x y,
\end{equation*}
yield the same equation of motion. Notice, however, that in the
alternative Lagrangian, varying with respect to a coordinate gives the
equation of motion for the other coordinate. Therefore, if we want to
restrict our system to the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, in the
second case the behaviour is as the one mention for the torsion-free
limit of the polynomial affine gravity.\footnote{A similar feature occurs in three-dimensional Chern--Simons
gravities, where the field equations coming from the exotic
Chern--Simons are \emph{reversed} with respect with the equations of
the standard Chern--Simons \cite{Witten:1988hc,Zanelli:2016}.} 

Notice that in the Riemannian case, the second term in
Eq. \eqref{almostSimpleEOM} vanishes identically. In the following, we
will restrict ourselves to the subspace of connections with
\(R_{\mu\rho}{}^\lambda{}_\lambda = 0\). The last assumption is
satisfied by connections compatible with a volume form,\footnote{Heuristically, we want to expand our connection, in the space
of solutions, around a metric compatible torsion-free connection,
i.e. close to the Levi-Civita one, therefore, we assume that it
preserves a volume element.} also
known as equi-affine
\cite{schouten2013ricci,nomizu1994affine,MO-Bryant02}. The equi-affine
condition assures that the Ricci tensor of the connection is
symmetric, and the contraction of the last indices vanishes, thus the
second term in the field equation is absent and the gravitational
equations are
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\rho} R_{\mu]\nu} = 0.
  \label{SimpleEOM}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{SimpleEOM} is a generalization of a condition known in
Riemannian geometry as covariantly constant Ricci curvature---aka
parallel Ricci curvature---, \(\nabla_{\rho} R_{\mu\nu} = 0\).
All Einstein manifolds, whose Ricci tensor is proportional to the
metric, \(R_{\mu\nu} \propto g_{\mu\nu}\), satisfy the parallel
Ricci condition due to the metricity condition, and therefore every
vacuum solution to the Einstein's equations solves the (simplified)
field equations of our model. Consequently, the fact that the
non-relativistic limit of the gravitational potential in
Eq. \eqref{NewtonPot} yields a Newtonian potential seems clearer, and
we can argue that even the post-Newtonian corrections coming from
General Relativity are present in the chosen scenario of our
model. However, it is worth noticing that we have found a set of
equations which generalise Einstein's gravity under the assumption of
vanishing torsion, while the non-relativitic limit found in
Ref. \cite{Skirzewski:2014eta} does not assume neither metricity nor
torsion-free conditions. As an additional comment, the parallel Ricci
curvature assures that although the manifold is not Einstein in
general, the metric has to be locally a product of Einstein
metrics \cite{Besse}.

The Eq. \eqref{SimpleEOM} is related through the second Bianchi
identity to the harmonic curvature
condition \cite{bourguignon1981varietes},
\begin{equation}
  \label{harm-curv}
  \nabla_\lambda R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\rho = 0,
\end{equation}
and it can be shown that a manifold with harmonic curvature is
equivalent (in four dimensions) to a manifold with harmonic Weyl
tensor and constant scalar curvature \cite{Berger:1969}, or in other
words the Ricci tensor is a Codazzi tensor.\footnote{A Codazzi tensor is a symmetric \((0,2)\)-type tensor, \(T\),
satisfying the condition \(D_X T(Y,Z) = D_Y
T(X,Z)\) \cite{Derdzinski01071983}.} For proofs of
these equivalences, see Refs. \cite{Derdzinski:1985,Besse}.

Notice that Eqs. \eqref{SimpleEOM} and \eqref{harm-curv} accept a
geometrical interpretation equivalent to that of the field equations
of a pure Yang--Mills theory, which in the language of differential
forms are
\begin{align}
  \cdf \Ff* &= 0, & \cdf \st \Ff* &= 0,
\end{align}
where \(\Ff* = \cdf \Af*\) is the field strength 2-form (the curvature
2-form of the connection in the principal bundle, see for example
Ref. \cite{bourguignon1982yang,Nakahara}), and the operator \(\st\)
denotes the Hodge star. Now, these Yang--Mills field equations are
obtained from the variation of the action functional
\begin{equation}
  S_{\textsc{ym}} = \int \Tr \Big( \Ff* \st \Ff* \Big),
\end{equation}
and the Jacobi identity for the covariant derivative.

Interestingly, the Eq. \eqref{SimpleEOM} (equivalently
Eq. \eqref{harm-curv}) can be obtained from an effective gravitational
Yang--Mills functional
action \cite{stephenson1958quadratic,kilmister1961use,Yang1974},
\begin{equation}
  \label{SKY}
  S_{\textsc{ym}} = \int \Tr \left( \Rif{}{} \st \Rif{}{} \right) = \int \left( \Rif{a}{b} \st \Rif{b}{a} \right),
\end{equation}
where \(\Rif{}{} \in \Omega^2(\Mi, T^*\Mi \otimes T\Mi)\) is the
curvature two-form, the operator \(\st\) denotes the Hodge star, and the
trace is taken on the bundle indices (see
Ref. \cite{bourguignon1982yang}).

The gravitational model described by the action in Eq. \eqref{SKY} is
called Stephenson--Kilmister--Yang (or SKY for short). However, the
standard interpretation of this model requires a metric tensor. A
quick analysis of the field equations a la Palatini shows that
Eqs. \eqref{SimpleEOM} and \eqref{harm-curv} are obtained only from
the variation with respect to the connection. Albeit this effective
theory has been widely studied, the extra field equation (for the
metric field) strongly constraints the solutions of the gravitational
Yang--Mills \cite{JZcomm}. However, that complication does not affect
our affine interpretation of the theory, where the metric is absent.

Intriguingly enough, the effective theory is not
renormalizable---according to the arguments in
Refs. \cite{McGady:2013sga,Camanho:2014apa}---, although it has been
discussed in Ref. \cite{Chen:2010at} that at least the ghost problem
can be avoided through the arguments exposed in
Refs. \cite{Kleinert:1987eb,Bender:2007wu,Bender:2008vh,Mannheim:2009zj}.

\section{Polynomial affine gravity coupled with a scalar field}
\label{sec.matter}
Until now, the most general diffeomorphism-invariant and
power-counting renormalizable (gravitational) theory for an affine
connection has been built, and we have showed that in a certain sector
it is a generalization of General Relativity. In what follows, we show
an attempt of including scalar matter into the model. The theory does
not require a spacetime metric, but instead we should consider the
most general, symmetric \(\binom{2}{0}\)-tensor density,
\(\mathfrak{g}^{\mu\nu}\), built with the available fields (see
Appendix \ref{sec.im}), and use it to build Lagrangian densities for
the matter content. Following our precept, the matter content---scalar
matter---should couple to \(\mathfrak{g}^{\mu\nu}\), given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathfrak{g}^{\mu\nu} = \alpha \, \nabla_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} + \beta \, A_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} + \gamma \, \epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\rho\sigma} T^{\mu, \lambda\kappa} T^{\nu, \rho\sigma},
  \label{geng}
\end{equation}
with \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) arbitrary coefficients.

We consider the action provided by the ``kinetic term''
\begin{equation}
  \label{ScalarAction}
  S_\phi = -  \int \dn{4}{x} \Big( \alpha \, \nabla_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda}  + \beta \, A_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} + \gamma \, \epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\rho\sigma} T^{\mu, \lambda\kappa} T^{\nu, \rho\sigma} \Big) \partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi,
\end{equation}
which makes a nontrivial contribution to the field equations once we
restrict to the sector of interest.

The equation for the Curtright field when the scalar field is turned
on is (without lost of generality we fixed the coefficient \(C_1 = 1\))
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla_{[\sigma} R_{\rho]\mu}{}^{\mu}{}_\nu - {C_2} \nabla_\nu  R_{\rho\sigma}{}^{\mu}{}_\mu - \alpha \nabla_{[\sigma} \Big( \partial_{\rho]}\phi \partial_\nu\phi \Big) = 0,
\end{equation*}
which under our considerations simplifies to 
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\sigma} R_{\rho]\nu} - \alpha \nabla_{[\sigma} \Big( \partial_{\rho]}\phi \partial_\nu\phi \Big) = 0.
  \label{SimpleEOMwS}
\end{equation}
In that case, we find a particular solution of
Eq. \eqref{SimpleEOMwS},
\begin{equation*}
  R_{\mu\nu} - \alpha \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial_{\nu} \phi = \Lambda g_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation*}
where we have used a suggestive notation by denoting with \(g_{\mu\nu}\) a
covariantly constant, invertible, and symmetric two-tensor. Notice
that \(\alpha\) is the gravitational coupling constant, which in
Einstein--Hilbert gravity is proportional to \(G_N\).  This equation can
be written in the more conventional form
\begin{equation}
  R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \alpha \Big( \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial_{\nu} \phi - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} \big( \partial\phi \big)^2 \Big).
\end{equation}
Additionally, the second Bianchi identity imposes
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^\mu \partial_{\mu} \phi = 0.
\end{equation}
This condition is, in the sense argued in
Ref. \cite{Bekenstein:2014uwa}, the equation of motion for the scalar
field. Notice that, the Euler--Lagrange equation of motion for the
scalar field yields no information after taking the vanishing torsion
\emph{truncation}.

It is well-known that this system of equations can be obtained
effectively from the Einstein--Hilbert action coupled minimally to a
massless scalar field
\begin{equation}
  S_{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \int \dn{4}{x} \sqrt{g} \left( R + 2 \Lambda - \frac{\alpha}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial_{\nu} \phi \right).
\end{equation}
We have show, so far, that our model of polynomial purely affine
gravity is compatible with General Relativity in the sector of
vanishing torsion, and in addition the compatibility can be extended
to include the interaction with a free scalar field. The analysis of
this coupled system could be enhanced to include a potential for the
scalar field, however, we are not considering this case at the moment.

\section{Analysis of propagators}
\label{sec.propag}
A step toward the analysis of renormalizability of the model should be
the computation of the free propagators of the model around a given
background. The choice of background is necessary in order to simplify
the computations.  Our first task is to expand up to second order in
the fields around a flat background. 

Therefore, in notation of Eqs. \eqref{GammaExp} we have that \(A = T =
0\), and the contribution due to the torsion and non-metricity enters
as a perturbative effect. Thus, most terms in the
action \eqref{4dfull} do not contribute to the propagator
analysis. Additionally, the first order perturbation of the curvature
tensor is
\begin{equation}
  R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\rho =
  %% \frac{\Lambda}{3}\,{\delta}^{\lambda}_{\mu} {g}_{\rho\nu} - \frac{\Lambda}{3}\,{\delta}^{\lambda}_{\nu} {g}_{\rho\mu}
  + {\nabla}_{\mu}{{\gamma}^{\lambda}\,_{\rho \nu}}\, - {\nabla}_{\nu}{{\gamma}^{\lambda}\,_{\rho \mu}}.
\end{equation}
Under these assumptions, the relevant terms of the
action \eqref{4dfull} are those accompanied by the couplings \(B_i\),
\(C_i\) and \(E_i\), and the second order perturbation of the action
yields
\begin{dmath}[compact, spread=2pt]
  \label{4dflatx}
  S^{(2)}[\gamma,t,a] =
  \int\dn{4}{x} \bigg[
    C_1 \big(
    %%- \Lambda {\gamma}^{\alpha}\,_{\beta \delta} {g}_{\alpha \gamma} {t}^{\beta \delta \gamma} +
    {\nabla}_{\alpha}{{\gamma}^{\alpha}\,_{\beta \delta}}\,  {\nabla}_{\gamma}{{t}^{\beta \delta \gamma}}\,
    - {\nabla}_{\alpha}{{\gamma}^{\beta}\,_{\beta \delta}}\,  {\nabla}_{\gamma}{{t}^{\delta \alpha \gamma}}\, \big)
    + 2\, C_2 {\nabla}_{\alpha}{{\gamma}^{\beta}\,_{\beta \delta}}\,  {\nabla}_{\gamma}{{t}^{\gamma \alpha \delta}}\,
    + E_1 {\epsilon}_{\alpha \beta \delta \eta} {\nabla}_{\gamma}{{t}^{\gamma \alpha \beta}}\,  {\nabla}_{\lambda}{{t}^{\lambda \delta \eta}}\,
    + E_2 \big({\nabla}_{\alpha}{{a}_{\beta}}\,  {\nabla}_{\gamma}{{t}^{\gamma \alpha \beta}}\,
    - {\nabla}_{\alpha}{{a}_{\beta}}\,  {\nabla}_{\gamma}{{t}^{\alpha \beta \gamma}}\, \big)
    %% + \Big(B_1 + \frac{1}{3}\, B_2 \Big) \Lambda {\epsilon}_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} {g}_{\eta \lambda} {t}^{\eta \alpha \beta} {t}^{\lambda \gamma \delta}
    %% + \Big( - B_3 + \frac{2}{3}\, B_4 \Big) \Lambda {a}_{\alpha} {g}_{\beta \gamma} {t}^{\beta \alpha \gamma}
    \bigg].
  \label{4dmax}
\end{dmath}
Longitudinal and transverse projectors can be introduced in order to
decompose the action and specify in a more standard fashion the
dynamics of Eq. \eqref{4dmax}. This can be done since we have the metric
\(\eta_{\mu\nu}\) compatible with the connection, and
\(\nabla^\mu=\eta^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu\). Additionally we will denote by
\(\Delta = \nabla^\mu\nabla_\mu\) the covariant Laplacian. Let us define
\(P_{\mathtt{L}}{}^\mu{}_\nu=\nabla^\mu\Delta^{-1} \nabla_\nu\), the
projector into logitudinal vectors, and similarly
\(P_\perp{}^\mu{}_\nu=\delta^\mu_\nu -P_{\mathtt{L}}{}^\mu{}_\nu\) is
the projector into transverse vectors. Therefore, transverse indices
are defined such that \(\nabla_\mu A_\perp{}^{\mu}=0\).

Thus, the perturbations can be split into their longitudinal and
transverse components as
\begin{dmath}
  a_\mu = {a_\perp}_{\mu} + {\nabla}_{\mu}{a_{\mathtt{L}}},
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}
  {t}^{\lambda \mu \nu} =
  {t_\perp}^{\lambda \mu \nu}
  + 2  {\nabla}^{\lambda} {t_{\mathtt{a}}^{\mu \nu}}
  - 2  {\nabla}^{[\mu}{{t_{\mathtt{a}}}^{\nu] \lambda}} 
  + 2  {\nabla}^{\mu}{{t_{\mathtt{s}}}^{\nu \lambda}}
  + 2  {\nabla}^{\lambda [\mu}{{t_{\mathtt{v}}}^{\nu]}}
\end{dmath}
and
\begin{dmath}
  {\gamma}^{\lambda}\,_{\mu \nu}  =
  {\gamma_\perp}^{\lambda}{}_{\mu \nu}
  + {\nabla}^{\lambda}{{\gamma_{\mathtt{s}}}_{\mu \nu}}
  + 2  {\nabla}_{(\mu}{{\gamma}^{\lambda}\,_{\nu)}}
  + 2  {\nabla}^{\lambda}\nabla_{(\mu}{{\gamma_{\mathtt{v}}}_{\nu)}}
  + 2  \nabla_{(\mu} \nabla_{\nu)} {{\gamma_{\mathtt{v}'}}^{\lambda}} 
  + 2  {\nabla}^{\lambda}\nabla_{(\mu} \nabla_{\nu)}{\gamma_{\mathtt{L}}},
\end{dmath}
where all the indices are transverse except those of the derivative
\(\nabla_\mu\), the subindex \(\perp\) indicates that it corresponds to the fully
transverse projection of the tensor in all of its indices, the
subindex \(\mathtt{L}\) indicates that this is the longitudinal
projection of the tensor, while the subindices \(\mathtt{s}\),
\(\mathtt{a}\) and \(\mathtt{v}\) specify whether the tensor is symmetric,
antisymmetric or a vector representation.

The perturbed action is then
\begin{dmath}[compact, spread=2pt]
  \label{pert-Lambda}
  S^{(2)} = \int \dn{4}{x} \, \bigg[
    - C_1 ( \Delta\gamma_{\mathtt{s}\mu\nu})^* \Delta t_{\mathtt{s}}^{\mu\nu}
    + \Big( ( C_1 - 2 C_2)  \Delta^2 \gamma_{\mathtt{v}\mu}
    - 2 C_2 \Delta \gamma^\nu_{\perp\nu\mu}
    - 8 E_1 \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\nu\mu} \nabla^{\alpha} \Delta t_{\mathtt{a}}^{\beta\nu}
    - 2 E_2 \Delta a_{\perp\mu} \Big)^* \Delta t_{\mathtt{v}}^\mu
    \bigg].
\end{dmath}
This action sets the dynamics of two (massless) transverse-traceless tensors (or
specific combination of tensors), as well as two (massless) transverse vectors
and two (massless) scalars, which are associated to ten degrees of freedom.

We have checked, using the method introduced in
Ref. \cite{Diaz:2014yua}, that the formal counting of degrees of
freedom for the effective action in Eq. \eqref{eff-action} yields (in
principle) ten degrees of freedom, since the fields in
Eq. \eqref{pert-Lambda} are massless. We discover during the
implementation of these program, that our model presents an extra
symmetry associated to the metric independence property, and a
thorough analysis of this \emph{symmetry} will be consider in a future
paper \cite{OCF-future3}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec.conclusions}
In this paper we have shown that the \emph{polynomial affine gravity}
presented in Ref. \cite{Skirzewski:2014eta} is the most general
(polynomial) model for an affine theory of gravity, see the
Appendix \ref{sec.ld}, consistent with invariance under
diffeomorphisms. Although one can assume that there is no metric in
the model, the right interpretation is that the metric plays no role
as carrier of gravitational interactions nor building the action. It
can be understood as a splitting of the two roles of the metric: the
one of measuring distances and the one of carrying the gravitational
interactions.\footnote{Similar to what happened in models of \emph{dynamical symmetry
breaking} within the standard model of particles, one can use a
technicolor condensate to break the symmetry but another mechanism is
needed to generate masses to particles
\cite{lane94_an_introd_to_techn,lane02_two_lectur_techn,hill03_stron_dynam_elect_symmet_break}.}

The action in Eq. \eqref{4dfull}, is characterized by
a nineteen parameters---after the boundary and topological
terms have been dropped---, which in some sense made us wonder about a
possible \emph{duality} between this model and the one proposed in
Ref. \cite{Pagani:2015ema}.  One feature that is worthy to highlight
is that this model is so robust, in the sense that it contains all the
possible terms allowed by diffeomorphisms invariance, that in the
case it could be quantized, there are no possible counterterms, i.e.,
it \emph{should} be renormalizable in its own, or it cannot be an
alternative to a quantum version of gravity.

The field equations obtained from the action \eqref{4dfull} are a very
complex set of coupled nonlinear partial differential
equations. However, the system is consistent with the limit of
\(T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}\) and \(A_\mu\) going to zero. This consistency is
what is usually called a \emph{consistent truncation} of the
theory. In this paper we have restricted ourselves to such a
truncation of our model, which constrained us to the torsion-less
sector of the parameter space. Additionally, this truncation leaves
only one nontrivial field equation, Eq. \eqref{almostSimpleEOM}.  By
considering torsion-free equi-affine connections---those preserving a
volume element---,\footnote{Or a Levi-Civita connection in the cases where the manifold is
metric and the metricity condition is imposed.} the remaining field equation simplifies even
further to Eq. \eqref{SimpleEOM}.

The equation \eqref{SimpleEOM} is a generalization of the field
equations from General Relativity, in the sense that, any Einstein
manifold (whose Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric) satisfy
the parallel Ricci condition,
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{\lambda} R_{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}

Although all Einstein manifolds satisfy the parallel Ricci condition,
the contrary does not hold. In Appendix \ref{sec.Known} we
present a summary of known (metric) solutions to
Eq. \eqref{SimpleEOM}. In addition, in Appendix \ref{sec.Schw} we prove
that a metric ansatz with spherical symmetry solves the field equation
only if it is static, i.e., a Birkhoff-like theorem for our
model. However, the non-linearity of the equations does not assure the
uniqueness of the solution. Nonetheless, certain equations become
linear if the functions \(A\) and \(B\) in Eq. \eqref{ABmetric} are
equal. Therefore, the unique solution is the
(Anti-)de-Sitter--Schwarzschild solution.

We also pointed that our field equation \eqref{SimpleEOM} can be
obtained from an effective action, known as Stephenson--Kilmister--Yang
(SKY) theory \cite{stephenson1958quadratic,kilmister1961use,Yang1974},
which is built up in the spirit of a Yang--Mills theory for
gravity. Despite the SKY theory has been criticized by many people,
including C. N. Yang himself \cite{JZcomm}, because its field
equations are higher order differential equations for the metric
field,\footnote{The field equation for the metric in the SKY theory is
so restrictive that the Schwarzschild metric is not a solution.} in
our model the fundamental gravitational field is the connection whose
field equations are second order. Although we have presented a series
of metric solutions of the effective field equations (restricted to
the torsion-free sector of the theory), the correct way to proceed is
to propose a connection ansatz compatible with the symmetries of the
problem. Using this procedure, we expect to find a non-metric solution
to the field equation \cite{OCF-future2}.

We would like to highlight that, since all gravitational effects
described by standard General Relativity are contained in our model,
particularly in the sector of metric compatible, torsion-free
connections, there is enough liberty to start considering new
cosmological effects coming from both nonvanishing torsion and
non-metric connections with vanishing torsion, beside the results
reported in Ref. \cite{Chen:2013kia,Chen:2013ota}.

As a first step toward the coupling of matter with our polynomial
affine gravity, we showed that there is a construct which might play
the role of an inverse metric density. Notice that such a tensor
density \emph{does not} necessarily satisfy a non-degeneracy condition
as required for a metric, but even though it is an interesting
question to ask under what considerations does this construct satisfy
the properties of a metric. Using this tensor density, we proposed a
\emph{kinetic} term for a scalar field (under diffeomorphisms), and
show that the effective field equations are a generalization to those
of General Relativity, when we restrict ourselves to the torsion-free
sector. Despite the fact that in this sector the field equation for
the scalar field collapses, and cannot be obtained from the variation
of the action, using the algorithm proposed in
Ref. \cite{Bekenstein:2014uwa}, the usual scalar field equation is
recovered in virtue of the second Bianchi identity.


Finally, we analyzed the second order perturbation of the action in
Eq. \eqref{4dfull}, around a flat spacetime. From this analysis it is
possible to conclude that, at perturbative level, the number of
degrees of freedom is ten, coming from a pair of transverse,
traceless, symmetric, rank-two-tensors, a pair of transverse vectors
and a pair of scalar fields. Moreover, we applied the Lagrangian
equivalent of Dirac's formalism for constrained systems (see
Ref. \cite{Diaz:2014yua}), and surprisingly the counting of physical
states does not match with the perturbative calculation---there are
known physical systems for which the perturbative analysis of degrees
of freedom do not coincide with the exact one.\footnote{We want to thank to M.~Blagojevi\'c, B.~Cvetkovi\'c and
O.~Mi\v{s}kovi\'c for clarifications in this respect.} Such mismatch
suggests the existence of an undiscovered symmetry. A detailed
analysis of this symmetry will be presented in an upcoming paper,
Ref. \cite{OCF-future3}.

\appendix

\section{Dimensional analysis method}
\label{sec.DA}
We built the model using six ingredients, a Curtright
(\(T^{\mu,\nu\lambda}\)), a vector (\(A_\mu\)), the covariant derivative
defined with the symmetric connection (\(\nabla_{\mu}\equiv
\nabla^\Gamma_\mu\)), both Levi-Civita tensors
(\(\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}\) and \(\epsilon^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}\)),
and the Riemannian curvature (\(R_{\mu\nu}{}^\lambda{}_\rho\)).  Since
the Riemannian curvature is defined as the commutator of the covariant
derivative, it is not an independent field, so it will be left out of
the analysis, and only five ingredients remain.

Our interest is in general to build tensor densities. Therefore, we
need to account for the number of \emph{free} indices, and weight
density of these quantities. Denote by \(N(\Phi)\) the operator which
count the number (and position) of indices of the field \(\Phi\), being
positive (negative) for upper (lower) indices. Thus, we have that
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    N( T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} ) &= 3 & N( A_\mu ) &= -1 & N(  \nabla_{\mu} ) &= -1 \\
    N( \epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} ) &= -4 & & & N( \epsilon^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} ) &= 4 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Then, for a general expression of the form
\begin{equation*}
  T^a A^b \nabla^c {\epsilon_{\dots}}^d {\epsilon^{\dots}}^e,
\end{equation*}
the indices counting yield
\begin{equation}
  N( T^a A^b \nabla^c {\epsilon_{\dots}}^d {\epsilon^{\dots}}^e ) = n,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  n = 3a -b -c -4d + 4e = 3 a -b - c + 4 \ell,
  \label{ni}
\end{equation}
where we defined \(\ell = e - d\), for the sake of simplicity.

In the same spirit, we define an operator which counts the weight
density,
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    W( T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} ) &= 1 & W( A_\mu ) &= 0 & W(  \nabla_{\mu} ) &= 0 \\
    W( \epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} ) &= -1 & & & W( \epsilon^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} ) &= 1 .
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the weight (\(w\)) of the general expression above is given by
\begin{equation}
  w = a + \ell.
  \label{wd}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Inverse metric density}
\label{sec.im}
Now, we illustrate the usefulness of the \emph{dimensional analysis}
by building the most general symmetric \(\binom{2}{0}\)-tensor density,
which we call the \emph{inverse metric density}. This particular case
fixes \(n = 2\) and \(w = 1\).


Equation \eqref{wd} can solved by choosing either \(a=1\) or \(\ell = 1\),
which imply that Eq. \eqref{ni} is restricted to
\begin{equation*}
  3 - b - c  = 2,  \quad \text{or} \quad 4 - b - c = 2,
\end{equation*}
respectively. The former, yields the terms
\begin{equation}
  T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} A_\lambda \text{ and } \nabla_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda},
\end{equation}
no other contraction of indices is allowed due to the symmetry. The
latter, yields another possibility,
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\rho\sigma} T^{\mu, \lambda\kappa} T^{\nu, \rho\sigma}.
\end{equation}

Finally, one can check that any other choice to solve Eq. \eqref{wd}, by
allowing negative values of \(\ell\), makes impossible to solve
Eq. \eqref{ni}. Ergo, there is no other term in a symmetric
\(\binom{2}{0}\)-tensor density built up with these fields. Explicitly,
this general tensor density is written in Eq. \eqref{geng}. The summary
of this analysis is presented in Table \ref{tab.imd}.

2 & 0 & 0 & -1\\
0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\

0 & 0 & 2 & 1\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Lagrangian density}
\label{sec.ld}
The work of building up the most general scalar density with our
ingredients is as simple as before, but the analysis is much
longer. Thus, we will show the procedure with lesser details than
before.

First, we are interested in a scalar density, which sets \(n = 0\) and
\(w = 1\) in Eqs. \eqref{ni} and \eqref{wd}, i.e.,
\begin{align}
  3a -b -c  + 4\ell &= 0, \label{nib}\\
  a + \ell &= 1. \label{wdb}
\end{align}

A possible solution of Eq \eqref{wdb} is \(a=1\) and \(\ell = 0\). Such
choice allows four possible solutions of Eq. \eqref{nib}, but only
three of them are nonvanishing. These generate the terms of
Eq. \eqref{4dfull} whose coefficients were called \(B_3\), \(B_4\), \(B_5\),
\(C_1\), \(C_2\), \(D_6\), \(D_7\) and \(E_2\).

If one choose \(\ell = 1\) for solving Eq. \eqref{wdb}, all possible
solutions for Eq. \eqref{nib} are either vanishing or yield
topological terms.

The case with \(a=2\) and \(\ell = -1\) gives three possibilities to solve
Eq. \eqref{nib}. These choices give the terms the Lagrangian density
whose coefficients are \(B_1\), \(B_2\), \(D_4\), \(D_5\), \(E_1\), and \(F_4\).

For \(a = 3\) and \(\ell = -2\) there are only two possible solutions of
Eq. \eqref{nib}, and these yield the terms of the action with
coefficients \(D_1\), \(D_2\), \(D_3\) and \(F_3\). And also, the choice \(a =
4\) and \(\ell = -3\) solves the equations, and yield the terms in the
action with coefficients \(F_1\) and \(F_2\).

Notice that for values \(a \ge 5\), it is not possible to solve both
Eqs. \eqref{nib} and \eqref{wdb} simultaneously. Therefore, we
conclude that Eq. \eqref{4dfull} is the most general action built up
with these fields. A summary of the choices for building the
Lagrangian density is presented in Table \ref{tab.ld}.

\section{Known metric solutions to the parallel Ricci equations}
\label{sec.Known}
Here, we will present a brief compendium of known (Riemannian) metric
solutions of Eq. \eqref{SimpleEOM} in four dimensions. The results
presented in this Appendix is not original, and can be found in
Refs. \cite{gray1978einstein,derdzinski1980classification,derdzinski1982compact,Derdzinski:1985,Besse}.

\paragraph{Einstein spaces.---}
The simplest example of a manifold with parallel Ricci is a Riemannian
Einstein manifols. This example was explained on the main text.

\paragraph{Riemannian products.---}
The Riemamian product of manifolds with harmonic curvature.

\paragraph{Conformally flat manifolds.---}
These are solutions in four dimensions if their scalar curvature is
constant.


\paragraph{Warped products.---}
Compact warped products of the form \((S^1 \times \bar{M}, \de{t}^2 +
  f(t) \de{s}^2(\bar{g}) )\), where \((\bar{M}, \bar{g})\) is an
Einstein manifold with positive scalar curvature, \(\bar{R} > 0\), and
\(f\) is a positive function on \(S^1\) satisfying the differential
equation
\begin{equation}
  \ddot{f} - \frac{1}{3} \bar{R} = c f,
\end{equation}
for a negative constant \(c\).

Twisted warped products of the form \((\R \times \bar{M} ) / \Z\) have
parallel Ricci, if the \(\Z\)-action on the product metric involves an
isometry of \(\bar{g}\).

Compact warped products of the form \((M_1 \times M_2, f^{2} \cdot (g_1 \times
  g_2) )\), where \(M_i\) are two two-dimensional manifolds, \(M_1\) has
constant Gau\ss{}ian curvature, \(K_1 < 0\), and \(M_2\) is an Einstein
manifold with scalar curvature \(R_2 = - 2 K_1\). The function \(f: M_1 \to
\R^+\) is a \(C^\infty\) solution of
\begin{equation*}
  \Lap f = c \, f^3 \text{ for } c > 0.
\end{equation*}

Many examples and explicit conditions of Riemannian metrics with
harmonic curvature, and conditions for them to have parallel Ricci,
can be found in Ref. \cite{derdzinski1988riemannian}.

Although the above are examples of manifolds with parallel Ricci
within the context of ``Riemannian'' geometries, examples of
connnections with parallel Ricci can be found in symplectic
geometries, see Ref. \cite{cahen2000symplectic}.

\section{Explicit example: Schwarzschild ansatz, and Birkhoff theorem}
\label{sec.Schw}
As pointed out, all vacuum solutions of Einstein's equations---with and
without cosmological constant---satisfy the parallel Ricci condition
trivially \cite{bourguignon1981varietes}. Nonetheless, an important
result in General Relativity is the stability of the Schwarzschild
metric, known as the Birkhoff
theorem \cite{Jebsen1921,Birkhoff1923,Alexandrow1923,Eisland1925},
which implies that the gravitational collapse of a spherically
symmetric astrophysical object cannot emit gravitational radiation.

In this section we show that the simplest ansatz of a static and
spherically symmetric metric, which solves the Eq. \eqref{SimpleEOM}
is necessarily the (Anti-)de-Sitter--Schwarzschild metric. This should
be taken as a first step toward a Birkhoff theorem, despite the fact
that a complete proof is far from been achieved.

Consider first the simplest metric ansatz, whose line element is
\begin{equation}
  \de{s}^2 = - f(t,r) \de{t}^2 + \frac{ \de{r}^2 }{ f(t,r) } + r^2 \de{\Omega}^2.
  \label{simpleSchw}
\end{equation}

The nontrivial field equation for the ansatz \eqref{simpleSchw} are
\begin{dmath}
    \nabla_{[\mu} R_{\nu]\lambda} = \frac{1}{2 \, r^{2} f^{3}} \Bigg( r^{2} f^{4} \frac{\partial^3}{\partial r^{3}}f + 2 \, r f^{4} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^{2}}f + r^{2} f^{2} \frac{\partial^3}{\partial t^{2}\partial r^{}}f - 4 \, r^{2} f \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}f \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{}\partial r^{}}f - 2 \, f^{4} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}f + 2 \, {\left(3 \, r^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}f - 2 \, r f\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}f^{2} - 2 \, {\left(r^{2} f \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}f - r f^{2}\right)} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{2}}f \Bigg) \,
    \delta_{\mu\nu}^{10} \delta_\lambda^0
    +
    \frac{1}{2 \, r^{2} f^{5}} \Bigg( r^{2} f^{4} \frac{\partial^3}{\partial t^{}\partial r^{2}}f + 2 \, f^{4} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}f + 6 \, r^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}f^{3} - 6 \, r^{2} f \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}f \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{2}}f + r^{2} f^{2} \frac{\partial^3}{\partial t^{3}}f \Bigg) \,
    \delta_{\mu\nu}^{10} \delta_\lambda^1
    +
    r \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{}\partial r^{}}f \,
    \Big( \delta_{\mu\nu}^{20} \delta_\lambda^2 + \sin^2(\theta) \delta_{\mu\nu}^{30} \delta_\lambda^3 \Big)
    +
    \frac{1}{2 \, r f^{3}} \Bigg(r^{2} f^{3} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^{2}}f - 2 \, f^{4} + 2 \, r^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}f^{2} - r^{2} f \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{2}}f + 2 \, f^{3} \Bigg) \,
    \Big( \delta_{\mu\nu}^{21} \delta_\lambda^2 + \sin^2(\theta) \delta_{\mu\nu}^{31} \delta_\lambda^3 \Big)
    = 0.
  \end{dmath}
Even though four out of the six nontrivial field equations are
independent, the system can be solved uniquely. First, the component
along the \((\mu\nu\lambda) = (2,0,2)\) yields \(f = T(t) + R(r)\). Then,
one notices that the equation along \((\mu\nu\lambda) = (1,0,1)\)
contains a term depending solely on \(t\), which implies that \(\dot{T}\)
vanishes, i.e., \(T\) is a constant. From here, the equation for
\((\mu\nu\lambda) = (2,1,2)\) gets simple enough to be solved and
yields, \(R(r) = 1 - T + \frac{\alpha}{r} + \beta r^2\) or equivalently
\begin{equation}
  f(r) = 1 + \frac{\alpha}{r} + \beta r^2,
  \label{simplef}
\end{equation}
with \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) integration constants. Finally, it can be checked
that albeit the equation along the components \((\mu\nu\lambda) = (1,0,0)\) was
not used, it is satisfied by Eq. \eqref{simplef}.

The above shows that the simplest time-dependent generalization of
Schwarzschild metric is not a solution for the field equations of the
considered affine model. Unless, the spacetime metric is static and
exactly that for a Schwarzschild's exterior solution, with or without
cosmological constant.

However, if one tries a metric ansatz with two different factors, say
\begin{equation}
  \de{s}^2 = - A(t,r) \de{t}^2 + \frac{ \de{r}^2 }{ B(t,r) } + r^2 \de{\Omega}^2,
  \label{ABmetric}
\end{equation}
the field equations are so complicated, that although hints on the
solubility were found---and yield to Eq. \eqref{simplef} for both \(A\)
and \(B\)---, the uniqueness of the solution has not been proven. The
field equations for the metric \eqref{ABmetric} are
\begin{dmath}
  \nabla_{[\mu} R_{\nu]\lambda} = \frac{1}{4 \, r^{2} B^{3} A^{2}} \Bigg( 2 \, r^{2} B^{4} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}A^{3} + 2 \, r^{2} B^{4} A^{2} \frac{\partial^3}{\partial r^{3}}A + 2 \, r^{2} B^{2} A^{2} \frac{\partial^3}{\partial t^{2}\partial r^{}}B - 6 \, r^{2} B A^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}B \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{}\partial r^{}}B - r^{2} B^{2} A \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}B \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{}\partial r^{}}A + 6 \, {\left(r^{2} A^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}B - r B A^{2}\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}B^{2} - 2 \, {\left(r^{2} B^{3} A \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}B + r B^{4} A\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}A^{2} - 2 \, {\left(r^{2} B A^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}B - 2 \, r B^{2} A^{2}\right)} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{2}}B - {\left(r^{2} B^{2} A \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{}\partial r^{}}B - 2 \, r^{2} B^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}B \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}A - {\left(r^{2} B A \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}B - 2 \, r B^{2} A\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}B\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}A + {\left(r^{2} B^{3} A^{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^{2}}B + 2 \, r B^{3} A^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}B - 4 \, B^{4} A^{2} + 3 \, r^{2} B A \frac{\partial}{\partial t^{}}B^{2} - 2 \, r^{2} B^{2} A \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^{2}}B\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}A + {\left(3 \, r^{2} B^{3} A^{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}B - 4 \, r^{2} B^{4} A \frac{\partial}{\partial r^{}}A + 4 \, r B^{4} A^{2}\right)} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^{2}}A \Bigg) \,

  = 0,
  \label{hugeeq}
\end{dmath}
which are very complex. Nonetheless, the symmetries in some of the
components of these equations seem to favour the relation \(A = B\) as
solution. In addition, we found a very interesting reference in which
a proof of the Birkhoff theorem is given for an Einstein--Cartan theory
coupled with the gravitational Yang--Mills \cite{Ramaswamy:1979zz},
which support the hand-waving symmetry argument above.

Hence, further analysis requires a new strategy. Instead of
considering a metric, a connection ansatz is proposed based in the
structure of a spherically symmetric metric of the form,
\begin{equation}
  \de{s}^2 = g_{ab}(x) \, \de{x}^a\de{x}^b + e^{2\rho(x)} \, g_{AB}(\vph)  \de{\vph}^A\de{\vph}^B,
  \label{sphere-gen}
\end{equation}
where \(x^m\) represent the temporal an radial directions, while
\(\vph^M\) represent angular coordinates. Notice that the
four-dimensional indices have been partitioned as \(\mu = (a,A)\),
then the general form of the connection is
\begin{dmath}
  \Ga^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu} = \delta^\lambda_a \delta^b_\mu \delta^c_\nu \ga^a{}_{bc} + \delta^\lambda_A \delta^B_\mu \delta^C_\nu \ga^A{}_{BC} + \delta^\lambda_a \delta^B_\mu \delta^C_\nu g_{BC} M^a(x) +  \delta^\lambda_A \delta^A_{(\mu} \delta^c_{\nu)} N_{c}(x),
  \label{connSchw}
\end{dmath}
where \(\ga^a{}_{bc}\) and \(\ga^A{}_{BC}\) are the Levi-Civita connection
for the metrics \(g_{ab}\) and \(g_{AB}\) respectively, and the factors
are \(M^a(x) = - \tfrac{1}{2} g^{am}\partial_m e^{2\rho(x)}\) and
\(N_c = 2 \partial_c \rho\).

From the connection ansatz \eqref{connSchw} the Ricci tensor is
\begin{dmath}
  R_{\mu\nu}
  = \delta_\mu^m \delta_\nu^n \big( R_{mn} - 2 \nabla_{m} N_n - 2 N_m N_n \big)
  + \delta_\mu^M \delta_\nu^N \big( R_{MN} + g_{MN} \nabla_{a} M^a \big),
  %% + ( \delta_\mu^M \delta_\nu^n + \delta_\mu^n \delta_\nu^M ) \gamma^A{}_{AM} N_n
\end{dmath}
and the equations of motion are
\begin{dmath}
  \nabla_{[\lambda} R_{\mu]\nu}
  = \delta_\lambda^l \delta_\mu^m \delta_\nu^n  \bigg( \frac{1}{2} g_{n[m} \partial_{l]} \mathcal{R} + 2 \mathcal{R}  g_{n[m} N_{l]}(x) - 2 \nabla_{[l} \Big( N_{m]} N_n \Big) \bigg)
  + \delta_\lambda^{[l} \delta_\mu^{M]} \delta_\nu^N \, g_{MN} \bigg( \nabla_{l} \nabla_{a} M^a + \frac{\mathcal{R}}{2} g_{la} M^a - 2 N_l - 2 \nabla_{a} \Big( M^a N_l \Big) - 2 M^a N_a N_l \bigg).
  \label{OurEq}
\end{dmath}
We have used that \(g_{AB}(\varphi)\) is the metric of a two-sphere, and
its curvature tensors are well known. In addition, since the metric
\(g_{ab}(x)\) is two-dimensional too, its curvature tensors are related
with the metric by the relation
\begin{dmath}
  R_{ab}{}^c{}_d = \frac{\mathcal{R}}{2} \Big( \delta^c_a g_{bd} - \delta^c_b g_{ad} \Big).
\end{dmath}

As argue  in Refs. \cite{bergmann1965spherically,hawking1973large},
the solution depends on the nature of the surfaces described by \(\rho
= \text{const.}\), which in our parametrization translate to the nature
of \(N_a\). We first consider the condition \(g^{ab} N_a N_b > 0\), which
allows to set \(\rho\) as a good radial coordinate. Therefore, the
general metric ansatz \(g_{ab}\) is diagonal, and the radial direction
would be \(\rho\), i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  g_{ab} = - \alpha^2(t,\rho) \de{t}_a \otimes \de{t}_b + \beta^2(t,\rho) \de{\rho}_a \otimes \de{\rho}_b.
  \label{metr2d}
\end{equation}
With this ansatz, the nontrivial components of Eq. \eqref{OurEq} are
\begin{align}
  \beta^2 \partial_{t} \mathcal{R} + 8 \gamma^\rho{}_{t \rho} &= 0,
  \label{eq1}
  \\
  \partial_{\rho} \mathcal{R} - 4 \mathcal{R} + 16 \alpha^{-2} \gamma^\rho{}_{tt} &= 0,
  \label{eq2}
  \\
  \partial_{t} \big( \Delta_x e^{2\rho} \big) + 4 \beta^{-2} e^{2\rho} \gamma^\rho{}_{t \rho} &= 0,
  \label{eq3}
\end{align}
and
\begin{dmath}
  \partial_{\rho} \big( \Delta_x e^{2\rho} \big) + 8 - 4 \Delta_x e^{2\rho} - 16 \beta^{-2} e^{2\rho} - 4 \beta^{-2} e^{2\rho} \gamma^{\rho}{}_{\rho\rho}  + \mathcal{R} e^{2\rho} = 0.
  \label{eq4}
\end{dmath}
From equation \eqref{eq1} it follows that,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{R} - 8 \beta^{-2} = G_1(\rho).
  \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
In addition, since
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_x e^{2\rho}
  = e^{2\rho} \bigg[ 4 \beta^{-2} + \frac{2}{\alpha \beta} \partial_{\rho} \bigg( \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \bigg) \bigg]
  \equiv  e^{2\rho} \Big[ 4 \beta^{-2} + \mathcal{F} \Big],
\end{equation}
it follows from Eqs. \eqref{eq3} that,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F} + 2 \beta^{-2} = G_2(\rho).
  \label{eq3b}
\end{equation}

Equations \eqref{eq1b} and \eqref{eq3b} implies that all temporal
dependence on time within \(\mathcal{R}\), \(\mathcal{F}\) and \(\beta^{-2}\),
enters through an additive common function, say \(B(t,\rho)\). However, the
consistency of these equations with the value of \(\mathcal{R}\)
calculated from the metric ansatz, in Eq. \eqref{metr2d}, sets this
additive function to zero, \(B(t,\rho)\). Therefore, neither \(\mathcal{R}\),
\(\mathcal{F}\) nor \(\beta^{-2}\) depend on \(t\). By extension---from the
definition of \(\mathcal{F}\)---, \(\alpha\) could depend on time through a
multiplicative function. Nonetheless, this multiplicative function can
be eliminated of the problem by a redefinition of the \emph{time}
coordinate.

At this stage, we have proven that for \emph{any spherically symmetric (metric) solution of the Eqs. \eqref{SimpleEOM} there exists a coordinate frame where the solution is static}, which is one of the main statements of Birkhoff's theorem.

This result, simplifies the Eq. \eqref{hugeeq} but the equations are
still non-linear. However, one can get ride off the non-linearity by
setting \(A(r) = B(r)\). In this \emph{linearized} regime, according to
Eq. \eqref{simplef} the general (metric) solution is the
(Anti-)de-Sitter--Schwarzschild metric.

Although we restricted ourselves to the \emph{linearized} regime of
the field equations, it is possible to go a bit further in the
nonlinear regime. As a preliminary result \cite{OCF-future2}, we have
found that using the Frobenius methods with a Laurent series
expansion, the leading order of the solutions is three-fold in the
radial coordinate. These solutions correspond to the pairs given by
\((\alpha,\beta)\)---\(\alpha\) (resp. \(\beta\)) is the leading order of
the series expansion for the function \(A(r)\) (resp. \(B(r)\))---equals
to \((-1,-1)\), \((2,-2)\) and \((0,-1)\).
